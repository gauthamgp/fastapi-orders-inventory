01:37:20	MOHAMMED PASHA:	.js is java script code?
01:37:26	Rajesh Sharma:	writing a code has become easy but understanding the AI written code and debugging it, modifying it to suit our purpose, will be requiring human intervention.
01:37:44	Bharadwaj V:	Sir they are saying a lot about AGI, how about employment impact?
01:37:51	Armaan Shaikh:	true that

01:38:47	Abhisheek Dutta:	Understood sir.
01:38:49	Akash G:	@Rajesh Yes, and we may need a lot of prompting to resolve the issue if the AI generated code is not working. And often it doesnot consider the challenges associated with real projects.
01:39:24	Ritik Kumar:	But knowledge is also more important. Those who have knowledge around the concept, then can give the correct prompt, and best prompt have optimal solution we can get
01:39:28	Rameshkumar Sellamuthu:	please run the execution
01:39:30	Ganesh Sahu:	it will increase testers job :) or may be technofunctional job

01:41:52	Akash G:	Thanks for covering these vibe coding platforms and how to use it, will be checking how useful they are in my project works.
01:41:59	Ujjawal Chaturvedi:	AI is not suggesting anything on monitoring side for this tech stack
01:42:21	Rajesh Sharma:	can we ask to find the defects in this code base and the challenges that it can face while going into PROD
