WEBVTT

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And load my meetup Kia Jai. Yes, I hear. Bangalorem, I can do a… we were, like, doing a lot of hackathons and, uh, a lot of big meetups.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:09.000
In Bangalore, so… I can, I can plan, because, uh… Bangalore is a place where I stay, so it's very convenient for me to organize such things.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Maniz is saying, what… what you're saying, Maniz? As long as I joined from USA due to time concern, I was not able to join a study class. Uh, not an issue. Uh, it's fine, so I have already uploaded the recording.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Okay, so, uh, can you plan this in progress? So, see, so once you say yes, right, so you keep on getting a demand that, okay, do this, do that everywhere, but yeah, practically it's not possible.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000
By the way, uh, Priagraz is a place where my in-laws belongs to.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Wife's hometown. Uh, so okay, fine, guys. So, let's get started. Good morning, everyone, once again. I think it's 9.05, and we all have joined a class.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Now, so yesterday, the way we have connected the entire class, so in the exact same manner, we are going to conduct a class.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:15.000
So, first of all, I'm going to, like, take a lecture. I'm going to discuss topics which I have to discuss, uh, for today, and then, so obviously, if you have any kind of a problem, or if you would like to discuss any kind of a doubt.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000
So, one by one, I'm going to unmute, and then we will be discussing doubts. And if you have to share your screen.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Right? So, for example, if I'm doing some sort of a setup, and maybe some of you are facing some sort of an issue in your system, you are not able to do a setup.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:38.000
So, obviously, uh, you can share your screen. We have that option as well. Not just an audio option, but yeah, screen sharing option as well over a Zoom.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And, uh, we… I have an option from my side that I can control even your screen. So I can, from here itself, so I can try to, like, do something in your screen.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:06:02.000
That is also possible, uh, case-by-case basis, right? So if you are facing any issue. And, uh, this is how we are going to conduct our classes. I believe I have already set the agenda, or I have already set that how classes is going to happen in my studies induction session itself.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Right? And this radio session was live on YouTube, but yeah, so from today onwards, it's not going to be live on YouTube, it is going to be here itself.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:30.000
And, uh, we are going to do all kind of a discussion. Now… Those who have joined today, because there are some people who were not able to join yesterday, uh, so… Uh, maybe, uh, like, you are not aware about the things that we have done, so let me just do a recap of each and everything that we have discussed in my, uh, yesterday's class.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Uh, just a quick recap, I would say. So I believe my screen is visible to all of you.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:45.000
No. So… Let's go to auron dashboard, and those who have missed, right?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:53.000
So let's suppose this is your bootcamp class, so just go over here, inside Continue Learning, and you will be able to find out a live lecture.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
So this is a link, by the way, so with the help of this link, you will be able to join your live classes.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:15.000
I believe you all have joined it with the help of this particular link, and I'm going to activate this particular link right before the class, means, again, one minute or maybe 30 seconds before, link will be activated automatically for that particular day, and you all will be able to join the classes.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Simple. So, like, there is no rocket science in this one.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Second thing is that, that, uh, yesterday we have conducted a lecture, right? Yesterday, it was an induction session, so I talked about a complete Euron ecosystem.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
So what we have and what we don't have, each and everything we have discussed one by one, one by one.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:45.000
So, starting from our home screen, or maybe a roadmap, or Euron+, Yuri APIs, just a brief introduction. So, I haven't gone into a depth of anything, but yeah. So, introduction about the.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:08:11.000
And we have done, and that induction session is already available. Like I said yesterday, and I'll keep on saying that it takes some time for us to upload a recording, most probably to do 3 hours of time, right? Because for 4 hour… of recording. Zoom takes around 3 to 4 hours to convert that video into an MP4, and once that will be converted, it will be uploaded. So, obviously, those who will not be able to join a particular class.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:22.000
You will have to wait maybe for, like, a 2-3 hour, so that we can upload. And today, we did the same thing, and we will keep on doing the exact same thing in each and every classes. It is not going to change at all.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Right. So, uh, those who have missed, uh, I will not say that to go through all four hours, if you have time, yes, you can go through it, but… Uh, maybe just, like, go ahead and just get a glimpse of this entire thing that we have discussed. Fine?

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Can we get an email with the class joining link for every classes? Uh, no, I don't think that email is required. We are already a part of a group, right? That's the reason, so I've created a WhatsApp group. Whatsapp is pretty much convenient. No one checks our email nowadays. So, can we get an email, can we get a notification?

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:06.000
I'll notify you inside a, like, your WhatsApp group itself, right? Because WhatsApp, I always feel like it's very handy, it's very convenient for me to answer any kind of a question, and yeah, so we all are available anyhow on WhatsApp.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Uh, WhatsApp is a universal tool now. Okay, and to those who are not able to get a WhatsApp link, it's also updated in the very first video itself, so click on the resources, you will be able to get a WhatsApp link for your badge. For every batches, we have a different, different WhatsApp group.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
This is our WhatsApp group dedicated just for your batch means, just for your badge.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Yep. I'm getting an email, uh, meeting link. Uh, because you have signed up in a Zoom, and in a Zoom, so we have switched that, uh, option that, uh, whenever you are going to sign up, so you will… Zoom will notify you automatically.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Yeah? Uh, it makes our bond stronger as well, exactly, yes, yeah.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:55.000
So what's up? It's like a, uh, pretty much okay with all of us, I believe, and we are not going to face any kind of problem, even after completion of the classes, even after completion of the classes.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:08.000
We will be connected for a very, very long time, because at the end of the day, we have to help each other, we have to, like, provide an opportunity or share an opportunity with each and everyone, and that's the reason, so I have just created a WhatsApp group.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
And yes, we are controlling, so I don't worry, we'll not allow any kind of, uh.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Unnecessary discussion inside the WhatsApp group. But yeah, so you are free to discuss anything. We are not, like, controlling anything.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
On a discussion side. So, just feel free to discuss anything.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Necessary one, yeah? So, necessary one. Okay, so this is all about my studies discussion, guys. Now, let's try to set an agenda for today's discussion. So, what we are going to discuss today.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000
So, first of all, I'll be talking about a system setup, because we have to start our syllabus.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Right? So, let me show you our syllabus. I believe yesterday you have already gone through it, but maybe not in depth.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:11:11.000
So, today, first of all, we are going to do a system setup. Bare minimum system setup we are going to do in today's class. Then, I'll be talking about a couple of things, not much, basically, from a generative AI perspective, and then a platform that we are going to cover, that we are going to discuss from a generative AI perspective.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:18.000
So that, so that, from next weekend onwards, next Saturday, right? So we have a class, same time.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
So from next weekend onwards, we can start learning an API first.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Technically, I'm going to teach you a fast API, so how you will be able to write a simple Python code.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:40.000
How you will be able to expose that Python code to the entire world with the help of FastAPI, or maybe with the help of Flask. So, both are basically a framework to create an API inside a Python.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Along with that, so here, inside our Yuri API. So, we have a multiple code bases, right? We have a multiple code bases for a lang chain, for a lang graph, for Lama indexes, for init, and for a.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Autogen. So how I will be able to use that part. Means, from next week onwards, we will get completely into a practical.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:18.000
But by taking a baby step, because I know that many of us are not aware about the API concept, right? And everywhere, whenever you are going to create an application, it will be required. So, believe me, even if you just know, like, what is a variable into a Python.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:30.000
I'm going to teach you an API in such a way that you will be able to create it, you will be able to expose it. So, I'm not expecting you to, like, you know, be an expert in a Python. And it's not that tough. So that's the reason I'm telling you.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:40.000
That even if you know how to declare a variable into a Python, only that part, right? Forget about oops concept, or maybe exception handling concept, or file handling concept, all of those things.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Just if you know that, okay, how to declare a variable into a Python, I'm going to teach you that, okay, how to create your own API, and it's that simple, actually, right? It's that simple. So it's a very logical thing that we all are going to enjoy it.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:03.000
So, fine, salary start, guys, are practical. Uh, in a group, I can see some message, but yeah, fine, my team is handling it, so… they will handle.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:16.000
So, sir, tomorrow clusterityata asks start kar sakte hain. Hanji, already agar aapne attend nahi kiya. Toh, recording is already available, so you can go through a recording, and then… Obviously, you can start, yeah?

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Fine. So, URI API is built on FastAPI, unknown, so our entire backend for Yuri API, especially for this one, is written in Node.js, basically.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Not on a fast API. We are not using Python as a backend for this one.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Uh, we are using Node. Our entire stack is on, uh, MORN, basically.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Okay, so, uh, in a group, I can see a lot of discussion going on. Is it necessary?

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Uh, yes, Live Link is not coming up after login. Like, people are able to join.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Yeah, maybe some people are facing an issue, because maybe they are new to a platform, it happens for a couple of initial classes, but uh… Yeah. So, fine, let's get started, guys, everyone. So, just try to open up a system. Yesterday, we had a lot of discussion with respect to our system, so let me tell you one thing very clearly.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Anything or any system, uh, which is equivalent to I5. Right? I5 is going to work. So, I5 is one of the minimalistic kind of a system.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:30.000
That you need, even for your day-to-day personal work, whatever work that you do, and even for learning these entire things, because.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Going forward, we have to introduce a cloud platform. So, the reason is very simple. So, let's suppose I'm talking about a fine-tuning, right? A model fine-tuning.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Uh, doesn't matter how good my system is. So beyond a certain capacity, or beyond a certain models, I will not be able to do a fine-tuning in my local system.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:15:01.000
So, I'm going to show you, I'm going to teach you that how you will be able to do a setup of GPU. There are so many vendors out there, for example, a Paperspace is one of the vendors, which we use, uh, frequently.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:13.000
So, basically, like, I'm going to teach you that how you will be able to do a GPU setup over those cloud platforms, and then how you will be able to do a training setup, so that you will be able to.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Like a dual fine-tuning with respect to a model. Depends upon the use cases, maybe a LoRa, maybe a Quora, maybe a SLM, maybe a quantization.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:26.000
These are the fancy words for you, I know, but yeah. So, eventually, you will be aware about that one.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Uh, so there will be not much of system dependencies. You will be able to find out in terms of a compute.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
But yeah, so if your system is having a higher configuration.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000
It will not give you a problem, as simple as that, right?

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
So, first of all, guys, what we have to do, uh, in my today's class.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:54.000
So, let me… write down the agenda that what we are going to do.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:02.000
So, agenda number one. Our very first thing that we are going to cover is a system setup.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:09.000
System. Setup. Agenda number two that I'm going to cover.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000
A major framework.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Framework, intro, just intro. So, I'm not going to go in depth, because for… Going into a depth, it's already a part of your soul labor. So, I'm just going to introduce a major framework, and I'm going to tell you a reason that, okay, so this framework we are going to use it for this particular reason, or that particular reason.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:43.000
So that you will be aware about these framework, at least with respect to a name. So, I'm not expecting that you should, like, get a mastery with respect to those frameworks in today's class.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:52.000
But no, I'm just… I'm just expecting you that. You should remember the name, only a name, that's it. Nothing more than a name at all.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:17:01.000
And then, uh, like, uh, third one, so… Yuri API.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000
A use. So, how I will be able to hit a URI system after doing a system setup.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
So this is something which I'm going to discuss in my today's class.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:18.000
So I'm assuming that all of you are ready with your system, so if not, please take your time to do 3 minutes at a time. Those who have joined through a mobile devices.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:25.000
So, please make sure that going forward, join through your system, join through your laptop.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:32.000
And, uh, whatever I'm going to do, so parallel, you will be able to do it. I will keep on pasting a link and code each and everything in your chat box itself.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Uh, in a real time. So that, I'll do it in my system, you will do it in your system.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Yeah? Fine guys, everyone? Can you please summarize how VIN AI apps are built? I think it's not a matter of summary, by the way, because yesterday we had a lot of discussions, and I simply said that, see, there is not one simple logic, one single thumb rule.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:05.000
That you can apply all across the application, right? So, it's a matter of practice, it's a matter of building something. And that is the reason we have the entire batch, yeah?

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Everything works for now, Zariq. Okay. So, fine. First of all, we have to do a system setup. Now.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:21.000
So we can write a Python code in our local system, and we can try to write a Python code, maybe, uh, in some ID which is available even online.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Apart from that, so nowadays, there are some IDEs which is available in a market, basically, which is going to help you out in terms of writing a code. And, uh, I believe we all have heard about a Vive coding, V-I-B.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:52.000
Live coding. So, where you just give a prompt, and then that ID will start writing a code. So, I will try to introduce to you with respect to live coding as well, a tool at least, right? A tool, at least, that, okay, so these tools that you can try to use.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:01.000
And then you will be able to do a live coding, so it is going to build a simple POC for you, or simple small MVPs for you. It will be able to build it.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:08.000
So, this is where this entire system setup will come into a picture, plus how you can do a local, complete system setup.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:18.000
So, first thing, guys. First thing. Uh, okay. So here, uh, you just go to Google and try to search for a Python.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:30.000
So, as we are going to write a code in a Python, and we are going to use a Python programming language, so those who have not done a setup, so just try to write Python download. So once you are going to write a Python download.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000
You will be able to see a link called as python.org, which is our official link, by the way, yeah?

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:42.000
And, uh, here, so this Python.org, let me… bring you this one. Fine.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:59.000
So, in this Python.org, you will be able to… I have already pinged you a link inside your chat, so you can check that out. So here, you will be able to see, uh, download option for a Windows, for a Linux, for a Mac machine. So, for all of these machines, download option is already available.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Now, so by default, you will be able to see our latest version, 3.13. I generally recommend people to go ahead with 3.10 version, because 3.10 is compatible with most of, I would say.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Most of the libraries or the frameworks that you are going to use inside a class, or even inside the industry. So, 3.13 is not that compatible, and 3.14, they have just pre-released, so it's not stable at all.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:43.000
So, I'll always recommend to go ahead with 3.10, but it's completely fine. It's completely fine if you are clicking over here, and then you are downloading 3.13 for now, because in later days, I'm going to even show you.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:58.000
That doesn't matter what is a base Python environment you have, you will be able to create a multiple environment. There is something called as a concept of virtual environment that we do, that we try to create with respect to a Python.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:17.000
So it's completely fine, yeah? It's completely fine. So, just go ahead and download this Python. Whatever you see as a latest version, download it, yeah? So once you will be able to download it, it's available, like I said, so it's available for all the machines, whether it's a Windows, Linux, or Mac, on the same location, right? So just select your machine.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:24.000
And then you will be able to download. Now, once you are able to download it, it's a very small file, so quickly you will be able to download it.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:35.000
So, again, just click over here, and then click, click, click, just like you do an installation for any other things inside your system. So, you will be able to do installation.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.000
Just make sure that while doing an installation, check this option, add Python exe to path.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:58.000
If you are not doing it, then in a later stage, you will have to do it manually. So you have to, like, add this particular path in a system variable, and especially for a Windows machine, for a Linux machine, for a Mac machine, you are not going to face such kind of an issue, but yeah, for a Windows machine, so you will have to either check this option.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
If you are not checking this option, so in that case, like I said.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Manually, you will have to go and edit your system in environment variable. So, first, guys, Python installation. I know many of you have already done that, right? Again, so those who have gone through my Python lecture, which I've already uploaded.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Even over there, so I have shown you the same thing, that, okay, fine, so go and install the Python, then go and install VS Code, all sort of the things.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Is it done, guys? Yeah? It's a very small file, so quickly, I think within 30 seconds of time.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:34.000
You all will be able to do an installation. Now, once you are able to do an installation, so how you are going to check.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:41.000
That, uh, whether it has been installed or not. So, to do it, right, to do it.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Open up your command prompt, CMD. Right, open up your command prompt, or maybe a power cell, and then simply type PYTHON Python space.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:23:10.000
Hyphen hyphen, V-E-R-S-I-O-N. Version. So Python space, hyphen hyphen version. Hit enter, and if you are able to see some version, doesn't matter, like, you are able to see the same version or some different version, but yeah, if you are able to see this particular version, it simply means that your system is able to find out Python.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000
Yes, your system is able to find out, basically, a Python. So, are you able to see a Python version, guys?

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:24.000
Just open up your command prompt and type this one. So let me ping you this inside your chat. Yeah, Python version. So I have already pinged you the command.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:31.000
Fine? So, this is the only requirement that we have. Beyond that, we will be able to do all kind of a configuration.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:48.000
Not showing in Mac, okay? So, which one? This command it is not showing in Mac?

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Yeah, so try with this Python 3, then. In the back, especially in Mac. In Windows, it will show, by the way.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:13.000
Right? And yes, we have an amazing, like, fellow learners who will be able to help you out, so that's a… That's very engaging things, and I can see, like, people have started replying even before me. So that… That shows the enthusiasm.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:28.000
Okay, so that's the reason we have a group event, so even if you're going to face some sort of issue after a class, so obviously, we have so many people out there, right? They will be able to help you out. And believe me, I have seen a group, and I have a lot of such kind of a group, so where even.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:35.000
After a two-switch or 3-switch, or three transition, people are helping each other, right? Even after, like, a 3 year, 4 year.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:43.000
I completed total setup. That's great, okay? That's great. So, fine, this is the Python setup that we have to do. So, step number one.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:52.000
They have to basically do a Python setup. Now, inside the same system setup, we need an IDE. Again, those who are not aware about it.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:25:02.000
So we need a place, we need a software, or you can say we need a tool where we can go and we can write a code, by the way. So that is something called as IDE, integrated.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:14.000
Development environment, right? My favorite one is VS Code. Now, someone likes some, like, PyChump kind of an ID, someone likes some different IDs, I like a VS Code.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:27.000
Again, ID-wise, all are good, all are, like, equally good, I would say. So, VS Code is very much a convenient one in terms of its UI interface, in terms of managing a code, in terms of executing it, in terms of.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:39.000
Like, uh, you know, uh… Uh, adding a plugins with respect to our VS Code, and that's the reason, so I, like, like VS Code, and I believe, like me, I'm not alone over here.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:59.000
So, the entire world loves VS Code, I would say. Yes? So… I love VS Code, as simple as that. Now, so VS Code is what? Vs Code is basically an IDE, yes? Ide. Integrated Development Environment. So, where you will be able to execute a code in any languages. Any languages, I mean, literally any languages.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:10.000
Uh, not by default, obviously. So, just now we have installed Python. So, now we can try to configure a VS Code inside our system. So let's go ahead again to the Google.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000
And, uh, such over here, V is code download, yeah? Vs Code.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:34.000
Download, and it's available for all machines. Mac, Linux, Windows, all three. So you are not supposed to worry about anything. So this is the official, right? This is the official, uh, like, uh… link, I have already pasted inside your group, yeah, so don't worry, you don't have to do a Google search even. I'll… I have already pinned you the link over here.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:46.000
So, just go over there, go to this link, the link which I have already pinged you inside your chat box, yeah? And hope all of you are able to open up.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:57.000
Yep, okay, fine. Uh, so now, if I have a Windows machine, I'll click here. If I have a Linux machine, so based on the Devian, or maybe a RPM, so I'll try to click here. And if I have a Mac machine.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:11.000
I'll try to click here. As simple as that. Very easy installation, again. So, no hustle, no struggle. So, just try to click, and as you can see, the time I have clicked, it has started downloading, right? It has started downloading.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:18.000
106mb of file, I can see, so it may vary system to system. System to system is Mac, Linux, and Windows.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.000
Yeah? Uh, so just try to download it. So, as you can see, I have downloaded.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:31.000
Right? Now, after downloading these files. Let me keep into a list view. Yeah.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:37.000
So once I'm able to download this file, this particular VS Core, again, what you have to do.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:47.000
So, click. Let me close my, uh… opened session of the VS Code.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:28:04.000
So, click, and then I agree, accept the agreement. Next. Create a desktop icon, add two paths, so by default here, it's checked. Add to path is required for Windows. Right, and sometime what will happen is that you'll have to restart your system. Sometime, not all the time.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:26.000
Uh, but yeah. So next. And then click on this Install. So automatically, it will be able to install each and everything inside your system. A very, very easy installation, only 2-3 clicks.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:32.000
Yeah? So are you able to do installation, guys? And click on Finish. Yes, click on just finish.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:41.000
So, it will be able to do an installation. Uh, let me close my existing session, and let me open up once again in front of all of you for the first time.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:54.000
Yeah? So, once you will be able to do an installation, so here, uh, if you are using a Windows, then you can come over here, you can try to search for it. If you are using a Mac machine or a command, then you can search inside your search bar or terminal.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Right? So just try to search for a VS, and automatically it will be able to, like, open up a Visual Studio code.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:12.000
This is one of the open source IDE. You all will be able to find out, so where you can build any kind of a project means literally any kind of a project.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:25.000
Which exist in this entire world, as simple as that. Yeah? Can you repeat the path selection? So you don't have to do anything with respect to path selection, just check that box.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:36.000
So, that is more than enough. We understood already how to change the path here or not. So, if it is working, then path is added. You don't have to do anything, yeah? By default, it will be able to select.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:50.000
Fine? Okay. So, VS Code, I'm able to open up, and I'm assuming that most of us are able to open up, right guys? Everyone? Can I get yes in a group? And if you are facing any issues, so you can let me know. If you're not able to.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:57.000
See something like this kind of a screen? So almost everyone is yes, no issue, okay, fine, fine, fine.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:06.000
Mac issue. Okay, so Mac… it's… I don't think that VS Code gives much of issue in a Mac. It's just drag and drop inside the folder, right?

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:18.000
With respect to a Mac? Yeah? But yeah, if you have a very, very old one, then it gives an issue, but it's easy to fix, I believe.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000
But JIP. So on JPET, NGPT, drag and drop it, simple.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Yeah? Albert and Mac. Fine. Yeah. So… Uh, we'll try later. Now, you can give try… you can try it even now, it's fine, like, it will not take more than 500 of time, uh, yeah.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:47.000
So, fine, a VS Code is installed. Now, VS Code will be a place where we will be writing a code. We will be writing a code almost like a 90% of the time, we will be building all this project, we will be doing a lot of, like, experimentation over here.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:31:08.000
Now, inside of VS Code, right, inside of VS Code. In-progress VS Code, sir. So, I'm giving you 2 minutes of time, so it's 9.031, right? So, I'm giving you a time of 2 minutes. Uh, those who are not able to do it, please do it quickly. Uh, you don't have to do anything, by the way. Let me ping you a link once again, so just go to this link.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:15.000
Yeah, just go to this link, download, click, click, click, install. That's it. Yep? Nothing much. And then launch it. Launch VS Code.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:35.000
Yeah, so I'm giving you two more minutes of time, guys.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:58.000
Uh, unrevising what? Path variable is equal to significance variable, Python environment compile default path? Yes.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:06.000
Okay, so once you are able to install a VS Code, and once you are able to see this one, right, once you are able to see this one.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:12.000
Then, you have to do couple of more steps, so that my system will be foolproof, and it will be ready, yeah?

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:21.000
So, when you are going to open up a VS Code, guys, yeah, whenever you are going to open up a VS Code, so you will be able to see.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:27.000
This particular option. Inside of VS Code. So there is an option called as Extension Option, this one.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:38.000
The marked one, the highlighted one, I'm talking about, right? So you must be able to see this particular option, so this is something called as extension. So, with the help of this, you will be able to install.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:50.000
Any kind of a extension. Extension simply means that additional capability, yeah? So, VS Code is an open source, uh, basically, IDEs, created by Microsoft, so major contributor of Microsoft.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:57.000
And then in a later test, so they have made it open source, and entire world is using this VS Code for writing a code.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:04.000
And even people are able to modify this entire VS Code, and they have launched their own labs, they have launched their own IDs.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:15.000
With their own version. So here, you will be able to find out an option of an extension. So, we have to use this option, and we have to install a couple of extensions over here.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:30.000
So, let's try to install those extensions in this particular place. So, you can try to click, and then you can try to open up this extension, yeah, by clicking it, or you can try to use a shortcut command for that one. So Ctrl-Shift-X.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:40.000
So if I'm going to close it, let's suppose, yeah, I'm going to close it. Ctrl-shift-x, and it is going to open up the extension. Now, once you are able to open up the extension.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:46.000
Try to search for a Python, first of all. Simple. Search for the Python, and if you are a country with the internet.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:58.000
You will be able to see a Python over here. Simple. And then you will be able to see a Python by Microsoft. So again, you can even try to publish your own.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000
Such kind of extension. I have published a lot of my extension on my own.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:09.000
So, uh, again, so I think I have not taught in any classes that how to build this kind of extension, but yeah, so I have already published it.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:26.000
A lot of extensions, so it's possible for even you to build an extension for your own purposes, wrap it up, and then publish it inside their store, so that other people will be able to use it. Similarly, so many people have already published these extensions, so this is from an official Microsoft itself.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:37.000
Search for a Python over here, and then you will be able to see a install option. So, I am looking at an uninstall option. The reason is very simple, I have already installed.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000
But, uh, you will be able to see an install option. Most of you, I would say, right, those who have not installed.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:49.000
So just try to click, and automatically, within a fraction of a second, it will be able to install it, yeah?

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:57.000
So, Ctrl-Shift-X in Mac, it will be Command-Shift-X. So, alternative for a control is technically a command.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:12.000
Yes? Yeah? How to build an extension, one video required. Yeah, I have already created one video on this one. Uh, not one video, I think multiple videos I have done on this one, how to create an SDK, basically, for PyPi. Maybe sometime I'll do it for extension as well.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.000
It's easy, actually. It's easy to publish.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:29.000
Okay, so this is the Python extension, guys. Again, I'm repeating the step, as you are new to our VS Core, right? So once you are going to open up a VS Code, like I said, you will be able to see an option, and we are going to use this option.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:43.000
So many times, not just for today. Even going forward, so I'm going to use this particular option. So, this is the option that you will be able to find out, called as extension. Now, what it does, so basically, there are so many tools, there are so many plugins, uh, people have created.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.000
Maybe for a code completion, maybe for a compilation, maybe for debugging the entire code basis.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:54.000
Maybe for, like, you know, showing you the code as a graph, basically, so that logically you will be able to connect.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:02.000
So, these are the additional capabilities, right? These are the additional capabilities that people or some organization keep on creating, keep on doing it, and there are, like.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:15.000
Millions. I'll not say thousands, by the way. So there are millions of such kind of extension people have created. Even you can create it, and push it to the store, so that people will be able to download, and people will be able to use it.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:37.000
So if that extension is that useful. So, here, just go to the extension tab, and then… Uh, just click, so you can use a Command-Shift-X if you're using a Mac, and if you're using a Windows, CTRL-Shift X, or just use a mouse, click. Simple. And search for a Python, then you will be able to find out a Python officially from a Microsoft.com.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:55.000
Yeah, Microsoft.com. So just install it, it will be done. So, this is one of the installations. By the way, you have to do, yeah? And then the second installation, second installation is… Uh, Jupyter Notebook, so J-U-P-Y-T-E-R, Jupyter, and then NOTB double OK. So, Jupyter Notebook is something that you have to search.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:09.000
Again, inside extension, I've just pinged you. Inside a chat. So, Jupyter Notebook is something that you have to search, and again, here, you will be able to see a Jupyter by Microsoft official one, yeah?

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:15.000
Jupiter by Microsoft. So, again, you have to just click, and it will be able to install it.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:31.000
Fine, guys, yeah? What are the list of the extensions? I mean, like, there is nothing called as, like, a list which works for the Gen AI. It's like general purpose extension people have created, and as and when we'll move inside the class, I'll keep on teaching you.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:39.000
Fine, okay? So, two extensions, one is a Python extension you have to install, and one is a Jupyter Notebook extension you will have to install, right?

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:51.000
No. So, once you will be done with these two installations, uh, so your VS Code is approximately ready, at least for now, I would say, at least for now. For today, it's ready.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:38:06.000
So now, in this Jupyter Notebook, first of all, you go to File, yeah? So, how do we create a project, by the way? So, what we do? So, we go to a file, we go to Open Folder option, yeah? So there is a folder option which is given to you. So, we go to an open folder option.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:13.000
And then, from here, you can choose any of your drive, right? Any of your drive.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:34.000
Or you can try to create, maybe, a new folder. So I'll be creating a new folder. For example, my badge is Gen AI, right? Gen AI, uh, let's suppose, uh, certification bootcamp. So, General AI Certification is a new folder I've created, and then I'll try to select. So that all of this code will be available inside this particular folder, GenAI certification that I have created. So, again, I'm going to repeat.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000
Go to File, right? Go to File is step number one. Step number 2, open folder.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:45.000
And then create a new folder. Let's suppose I'm going to create Gen AI test folder, select it, select this particular folder. Now.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:54.000
Whatever code you are going to write, it will be available inside this particular folder. You can even right-click, you can try to copy the path.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:04.000
Light. You can copy the path, you can even click on this Find folder, and you can, uh, like, if you would like to, like, know that, okay, at which location this file is in my system, so I right-click.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000
In this space, copy the path, and then I can try to go.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000
Here, and here is a path, right? D drive, gen AI test.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:20.000
Simple. It's very simple, very convenient. So, here, just as you have to, like, do a couple of clicks, you will be comfortable.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:35.000
So it's not that tough. Those who are new to a VA school, let me tell you, it's not that tough at all. It's very, very easy. So, you just have to do a couple of clicks here and there, which we all are doing. So, by today, today's end itself, you will be comfortable with a VS Code.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:47.000
So here is a folder I have created, and now in this particular folder, uh, so I can write any kind of a code. I can try to create a folder inside a folder. I can do technically anything and everything that I want, as simple as that.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:52.000
So here, let's suppose I have to create a file, so where I can execute my code.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:40:04.000
Right-click, once again, and then New File, yeah? New File. And here, so I can try to create my file with any name that I want, but extension should be intact. For example.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:15.000
So, here, let's suppose if I'm creating a test, right? Test. And let's suppose if I have to create a Jupyter notebook kind of a file, a Jupyter notebook extension that we have installed just now, right?

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:35.000
So I'll give a file name, dot, I'll give IPYNB. So I, Python, Jupyter Notebook. This is what it means, by the way. So, filename.ipynb, all the time. Hit enter. Now, you will be able to see a Jupyter Notebook kind of a system, right? Where you can try to write a code, and you can do whatever you want.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:50.000
Want. But, so let's suppose… and this is possible, right? This is possible because of this extension. So, the Jupyter extension that we have installed, right? Jupyter Notebook extension that we have installed, it's possible because of this extension, so I will be able to.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Execute a Jupyter notebook inside my system. Now. Sometimes, so why Jupyter Notebook is important? Why Jupyter Notebook is required? Reason is very simple. So, sometime, line by line, we'll write a code, will try to, like, see the explanation of a code, will do a lot of experimentation. This is a place where Jupyter Notebook is required, but, but, but…

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:22.000
When it comes to building an application, right, when it comes to building an application, when it comes to modular coding, right, a standard approach that we try to follow.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:40.000
At that point of a time, it's not a Jupyter notebook, it will be a multiple folders, multiple structures, and then inside that, there will be a multiple modules. Technically, a .python file I'm talking about, a .py file I'm talking about, right? So we'll do a lot of experimentation over there. I'm going to use a Jupyter notebook, and then.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:51.000
Obviously, a .py file I'm going to use. Making sense, guys? I had a version 3.0? Yeah, so let's not fight on version side of it. Any version is fine for now, because anyhow, I'm going to teach you.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:56.000
How to create a virtual environment. So, over there, again, I can control any versions.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:03.000
Fine? So what is the difference between IPR and a PI file? So basically, both are different file structures. Ipn view simply means that it is going to open up in this.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:16.000
Type of format, where in a tab you can write a code, but yeah, you can't do a modular coding over here.py file means folder inside the folder, and you will be able to do a modular coding. And eventually, we have to leave a Jupyter notebook.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:33.000
Technically, I used to say that Jupyter Notebook is for a beginner, or, like, uh, let's suppose I'm teaching you a Langchain, Langraph, something like that, right? So, initially, I will try to start with the Jupyter Notebook, but eventually, when I will teach you that how to use those things and build a project, build an application.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:50.000
At that point of time, I can't use a Jupyter Notebook, right? When I say that, okay, let's go and deploy this project, again at that point of a time, I will not be using a Jupyter notebook. I will be using a complete, full-formatted model coding structure, right, which will be required, as simple as that.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:59.000
Yeah, please show me again how to open up Jupyter Notebook. It's nothing, basically. Right-click, create a new file, right, give a file name, for example, test1, and then.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:07.000
Your extension should be .ipYNB, I-P-Y-N-B, IPython Jupyter Notebook, simple. So, your extension should be IP, Y, and B.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:19.000
And then, bingo, done, right? Yeah. So, here in this way. So, just look at my extension, it should be exact same. File name could be anything, it's fine. Test one I have given, test I have given.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:31.000
You can give your name, you can give my name, that's completely fine. Extensions should not change. Ipy and B should not change, because this is how system will be able to understand that this is a… it's a Jupyter notebook that I'm talking about, by the way.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:41.000
Yeah? Now, so, uh, here, when you are going to call a Jupyter notebook, by default, it will not be able to execute anything. So, let's suppose if I'm writing 1 plus 1, and if I'm going to execute it.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:51.000
How to execute, so I can try to click on run, or I can use a sift enter. Shorthand is basically, I can even click here to run the cell, execute the cell. So, as you can see.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:44:01.000
My mouse cursor, right? So just look at my… let me, uh…

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:07.000
Use my… yeah. So I think you are able to see my mouse cursor with the red dot.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:14.000
Right? Red dot. So, this is a place where you can try to click, and you will be able to execute it. And when you are executing for the first time.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:23.000
So, as of now, this is technically… this is technically just a file. So, it is not having a Python access. See?

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:35.000
Uh, I have told you in the beginning itself, right, that I can try to use our VS Code to write a Java code, to write a C++ code, to write a JavaScript code, means language is not a barrier.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:41.000
Uh, if you remember, in a beginning itself, what we have done, so we have technically installed Python.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:47.000
Yeah, in our system. Vs Code will be… able to use it. Vs Code will be able to invoke it.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:45:12.000
Because now Python is available, a core library, which is required to execute any of my Python code. It's already available, and then we have done the installation of VS Code. So technically, VS Code is using a Python that you have already installed. Similarly, you can install a Java SDK, and then you will be able to write a code in Java, as simple as that. Now here, so once you're going to click on execute, it will not be able to execute.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:30.000
Because, because you have to attach. Attach what? So you have to attach your installation. What installation? Obviously, Python installation you have to attach, right? You have done the Python installation. So here, you have to select a Python environment, so click over here.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:35.000
And then you will be able to see some base environment in your system. So I'm able to see multiple environments, right?

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:44.000
So let's suppose you are able to see this kind of environment, Python 3.12 or maybe Python 3.13.10, whatever. This is called as base environment.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:49.000
Take it, right? Take it. Now, you will be able to execute it. In my system.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:57.000
Required, and if it is going to give you some pop-up for installing a kernel, just click yes. Just say yes, it will be able to install the IPYNB kernel.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:04.000
For this Jupyter Notebook, for this particular environment. So, again, going to repeat, guys, again, going to repeat. So, see.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:20.000
You have to, as of now, I can see, like, a Python 3.12, right? Python 3.12. And I have attached with respect to a test one Jupyter notebook. Now, again, in a test, every time you have to do it, so every time, whenever you are going to create a new Jupyter notebook, it is going to ask you to do the same thing.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:28.000
So let's suppose test. I have not attached any kind of a kernel. Kernel means executor. Like, basically a thing, a system.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:35.000
Which will be able to understand my Python code. So here, I can try to click on Select Kernel, simple, right? Yeah?

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:41.000
And, uh, by default, I have used it recently, so it is showing me. Otherwise, I can click on select another kernel.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:51.000
A Python environment I have to select, right? And here, in my system, you will be able to see hundreds of environment, but if your system is new, you will not be able to see all the hundreds of environment.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:59.000
Uh, you will be able to see just the installation that you have done as of now, right? And the installation which has been attached to your path, system variable.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:16.000
So, just click Select, and it will be able to, like, take that particular environment. Very simple. Now, if I'm going to write a code, for example, 1 plus 1, if I'm writing, and then if I'm hitting Shift-Enter, or CTRL-Enter, or if I'm going to click over here, click over here, as you can see, it is able to.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:28.000
Execute, and I'm able to see the output. And if you're able to see the output, it simply means that my Jupyter notebook is up and running, it's working, I don't have to worry about anything, now I can… I'm good to write any kind of a code.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:44.000
Yep. Yeah? So, you will face some issues with respect to a clique's, believe me, with respect to, like, selecting a kernels. I don't think that… anyone who's going to… face an issue once you will be able to, like, uh.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:54.000
Connected. Yes? Now, shorthand, so here, there is a, like, a click, right? A shorthand for this one is Ctrl-Shift, and here, P.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:05.000
Yeah? P. So, you can try to… so it will try to open up a search bar, basically. Those who are using Mac, it will be Command-Shift-P. So again, when I say Control, Mac people, just change it to Command.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:10.000
Yeah, change it to command keyboard, because there is no control in a Mac system. So Ctrl-Shift-P.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:17.000
Uh, foothand, basically. So, one option is click, and then select, right? Other option is Ctrl-Shift-P, and then here.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:24.000
So you can go Pyth… you can try to go and type Python, and then you can try to use a select interpreter.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:30.000
Yeah, select interpreter. Same place you will be able to land. So, Ctrl-Shift-P, select interpreter, same place.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:35.000
And shorthand is going to work for all the machines, as simple as that. Making sense, guys, to all of us? Yes?

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:43.000
So are we able to attach a kernels? Because if kernel is not attached, you will not be able to execute any code means literally any code in Python.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:51.000
Simple. Can you provide the steps for default Python environment selection? Simple. Ctrl-shift-p, right?

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000
Type Python, it will show you all the list of environment.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000
Python environment, it will show you all the list. Yeah? Karthik?

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:14.000
And everyone. So, are we able to do it, guys? Yes, everyone? It's not tough, but I know, like, for the very first time, when you see the system, right? Because this is something that you will be doing daily, maybe once in every hour, once in every half an hour you will be doing.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:23.000
But yeah, I know that initially when we are very new to these things, we face some sort of issues, yeah? And those who will be facing these issues, even after a class.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:30.000
Feel free to share your screen, I'll look into your screen, I'll fix it. It's not a big one, I know, but yeah, I'll fix it.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:36.000
After the class, right, in our doubling session. That's the reason, so we have a doubt clearing.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:41.000
Yeah. It is not taking environment. Sometimes you will have to, like, close it, open up once again, sometimes you have to even restart.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:50.000
Or maybe just go ahead with this, uh… if it is showing you environment in CMD, right? It will be, like, giving you environment.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:50:01.000
That's the reason why I've just asked you, asked everyone that go ahead and check inside the command prompt, and there's a possibility that environment is not added, then manually you have to go to your environment variable, and then you have to add it.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:09.000
Because that's the only issue. Apart from that, no one is going to face, believe me, any other issues with respect to this setup. And this is just one time.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:23.000
For the very first time. Yeah? So, hope, uh, we are able to make our Jupyter notebook up and running inside this one. Now, another kind of a file, a Pythonic file you can create over here, so just right-click, New File.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:29.000
And, uh, here I'm going to write test 2. Dot pi.py, dot only py.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:36.000
And here, so again, you will be able to write a code, yeah? Again, you will be able to write a code. So, for example, I'm writing print.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:43.000
Uh… And my name is?

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:52.000
Sudhansu Kumar, yeah? So, this is, again, another file where I'm able to… where I will be able to write the code.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:57.000
And I will be able to execute even this particular one.py file. So this is another extension.py.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:08.000
A majority of times, you will be able to see me, or you will be able to find out that I'm creating .py file, in terms of creating a project, in terms of creating the full-fledged application.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:15.000
So, which you can push it into a production system. I will not be pushing a Jupyter notebook, by the way, yeah? Like I said.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:22.000
It's good to, like, you know, break down the code into a line-by-line steps, and execute it, and, uh, like, see the explanation.

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:30.000
But not good for, like, modeler coding, yeah? That's the reason why I keep on saying it's for a beginner. So, as a beginner, we can use it.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:41.000
But yeah, there is also a provision where you can try to productionize the entire Jupyter notebook in a Databricks, for example. So they provide you a Jupyter notebook, you can try to productionize the entire Jupyter notebook, that is also possible. So, I'm not denying.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:58.000
Even that possibility. Okay. So here, if I have to execute .py file, simple, right-click, and then I can try to execute, or run in Python the option that you will be able to see. Otherwise, you will be able to see where is my…

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:08.000
Dot. Yeah. So otherwise, you will be able to see even this option. So, you have to, like, click, right? As you can see, my arrow, arrow marks.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:12.000
So you can try to click over here, and then you will be able to.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:26.000
Use this option. As simple as that. Let me remove my arrow. Yeah. So, just follow my mouse pointer. So, here, click, and then run Python file. So, once you are going to call, click run Python file.

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:36.000
Whatever I have written over here, I'm able to see it, right, in my output. My name is Anshu Kumar, this is something which I have written, and uh… yeah, same thing I'm able to print it. So, both of my.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:46.000
Like a way of executing a code is working. My IP UN file, my Jupyter file is working, and my .py file is also working. Both of this.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:51.000
In my local system. Fine guys, everyone, are we able to execute it?

00:52:51.000 --> 00:53:03.000
Both the files. It means we are able to do a system setup.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:09.000
Show me.py file. It's nothing, by the way. So, right-click.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:15.000
New file, uh, test 2. Extension, just give extension, just a matter of extension, by the way.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:20.000
So.py file, right? And now here, I'll go, I'll write something.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:25.000
That, uh, this is my… Second Gen AI.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:30.000
Class, yeah? Ctrl-s, save it. And then I have to execute this entire file.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:37.000
So, I'll go here. Follow my mouse cursor. So, I'll go here.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:42.000
Run Python file, yeah? Runpython file. And I will be able to see the output.

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:50.000
Simple. Nothing… it's nothing, actually. Yeah. So, both the mode is ready in my local system.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:58.000
No. So, this is not the only option which is available to me, by the way. So, I have other options which is available to me. For example.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:05.000
Uh, I can go to Google, once again. And I can try to search for, uh, collab.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:16.000
G-o-g-l-e-c-o-l-a-b, Gualcolab. So basically, Google Colab. Is a notebook kind of a structure, which you will be able to get from a Google itself, yeah?

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:21.000
Google itself. Let me ping you this one inside your chat. So yeah, I have already pinged you.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:28.000
So here, you can come, and you can try to create a notebook.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:33.000
Jonly notebook, not IPY, not Py file, basically, only a Jupyter notebook, you will be able to create over here.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:47.000
So let's suppose if I'm going to click on New Notebook, find new notebook. So, again, if you are using this one, then there is almost no load on your system, because everything will be, like, executed inside a browser.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:55:01.000
Right? Everything will be executed inside the browser. So even over here, you can do 1 plus 1, and then you are going… you can try to execute it. Now, once you will try to hit execute, it will show you, um, like, a dot dot dot here. Just follow my mouse cursor.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:12.000
The red dot, right? So, it is going to allocate our resources. So, it is going to provide you a shared resource. By the way, you will be able to see those resources over here.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:18.000
That it has provided you, uh, 12.7GB of RAM, and then 107GB of a hard disk.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:38.000
A shared one, by the way, not a dedicated one. So they are providing you, and you will be able to write a code, you will be able to execute a code even over here inside a Google collab. You can even download this code, right? So you can try to download this code as a Jupyter Notebook file, IPYNB file.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:43.000
And then you can try to open up in any other places, in your VS Code.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:55.000
Again, so many beginners, right? Many beginners. So let's suppose, uh, we have created a file, and let's suppose I'm going to download this file, IP-only file. So, this is something which I have downloaded, where I have 1 plus 1.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:06.000
Right? So, many people initially have seen that they will try to open up this file directly. For example, if you are going to open up this file, where is my open option? Yeah.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:14.000
So if I'm going… not in here. So, let me open up this file inside.

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:28.000
A text or something. Choose another app. So many people, by default, they will try to open up their file inside a notebook kind of a structure, right? And when you try to open up a file IPU any file, especially, into a notebook kind of a structure.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:38.000
It will show you some format like this, and people say that I'm not able to open up the file. Yes, you will not be able to open up the file, you will not be able to see the content.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:53.000
If you are not opening up your IPYNB file in an IPYNB compatible environment, as simple as that. If you're going to open it up into a… some notebook, it is going to show you those kind of a result, a kind of a JSON format, it is going to show it to you.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:57:08.000
Yeah, which you will not be able to understand. So this is the issue, a common issue, which some of you are going to face. Initially, couple of times, but after that, you will be able to understand that, okay, fine, this is not an issue, actually. I have to open up into a VS Code, or.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:16.000
A place, a reader where it will be able to understand this file extension.py file, you can open up into a Jupyter notebook, uh, sorry.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:22.000
Dot py file, you can open it up into a text editor, that's completely fine. It is not going to change, but yeah.

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:27.000
That is an issue you are going to face with respect to IPYNB if you are a beginner.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:32.000
A simple step is, open it up into a VS Code, not into a text editor.

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:47.000
Yes? Uh… is… it is asking for a Python interpreter, some SumSries saying. So, yeah, click and then select the Python interpreter. It will show you the drop-down, right?

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:57.000
Always used a collab generative AI work without a GPU. See, generative AI work doesn't require a GPU. Understanding you're not doing a model training.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:05.000
And then in financing. Right? It's a myth that generative AI requires, like, a GPU all the time.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:10.000
Because all the time, you will not, like, you know, end up doing a fine-tuning of the model.

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:23.000
Yes? So, okay, uh, so here is a collab, uh, another place where you will be able to execute your code, and if you're not able to do a configuration, because here.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:35.000
You are not supposed to do any kind of installation. By default, installation, and everything is done. You don't have to go ahead with the Python installation, just come over here, and then start writing a code, and it will be able to execute your code. As simple as that.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:44.000
Now, like a Guelp collab. So, Gold Kulab is not just one system, I can go over here, and I can try to search for a Jupiter.

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:55.000
Notebook online, yeah? Just go to Google. You will be able to see 10 other options. So, where you can go and you can try to, like, you know, good, bad, that's a different story.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:03.000
Right? That's a different story. But you will be able to see a 10 different online options, so where you can go, and you can try to, you know.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:15.000
Execute our code. So those options are available. A collab is one of the best ones, because it gives you more resources, so that you can execute a bit of heavy code as well.

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:21.000
Yeah? This is where collab comes into a picture. You have a… it's from a Google itself, right? It's from a Google.

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:27.000
So they give you a lot of options, but this is not the only option. Even in an online mode.

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:31.000
Where you don't want to do any kind of installation in your local system.

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:40.000
We have an option. We have a lot many options, even in a online mode, and that too free. All of these are technically free to all of us.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:50.000
For the infinite time, they are not going to charge you. Google Collabs, uh, sometime back, they have, I think, 2 or 3 years back, they have released a option called as ProOption, World Collab Pro.

00:59:50.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Where they were charging, like, a $10 per month. But I don't think that they have, like, that option even now. Because in India, I'm not able to see it. And even back then, when I've checked.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:10.000
So, it was available in USA and some other reasons, but not in India, where they give… they were giving you, like, a more resources. More resources means this one.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:19.000
The RAM and hard disk. They were giving you more resources, and uh… but I don't know whether they are giving it now or not. I haven't checked.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Yeah? Uh, Kegel Notebook, yes, there are tens of other places. There are so many other places at the end of the day, I have to write my code, I have to build my project, that's it. So, doesn't matter whether I'm doing it here or somewhere else.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:41.000
A baseline is completion of the task is something which matters. In future, do we need a TPU on collab? Uh, no, not like a TPU.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:51.000
On Gulab, yeah? Okay, so using a cursor ID for everything, I hope it's fine. Okay, coming to that point as well.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:56.000
So, fine, guys. So, VS Code set up in local, we are able to do it, right? And then Google Collab.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Now, so, in a VS Code and inside a goal collab, you will have to go and write a code, and then there is an extension you can try to install.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Uh, uh, where it will help you out in terms of code completion. And we are living in a world of AI.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Right? Era of core AI, and we are trying to learn generative AI. So technically, we are even trying to learn AI itself.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Right? So obviously, if we are not going to use an AI while learning.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Night, while learning, or while building a project. So, I think, uh… Then what is the use of learning and AI, right? What is the use of learning in AI?

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:45.000
So, obviously, we have to build bigger. See, AI is going to help you out always in terms of building up bigger things, right? Bigger things.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:52.000
So, obviously, we all have to use, I believe my, uh, yeah, so I'm visible.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:02:00.000
So, basically, we have to use an AI, even in a day-to-day basis, while building our things, right? While building our things.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:09.000
And this is where live coding comes into a picture. So, where you are not supposed to write a many line of code.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:28.000
A system will do it, with the help of Prompt. We all know that, right? That, okay, I can give a command and then ChatGPT will be able to write, like, a code for me. I believe we all have tried that path. Chatgpt or maybe a… like a cloud day, or maybe PopExlity, or Gemini, there are tons of other platforms, and we have Yuri.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:35.000
So guys, have you tried Uri yesterday? Yeah, and how was your experience, by the way? Those who are new.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Those who are the old I know, like, they're comfortable with Yuri.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:49.000
But, uh, have you tried Yuri? Yeah. So maybe after one year, Purple City has given a free access to all the Airtel user in India, right? Maybe after one year, they're going to charge you.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:57.000
But this will be Avil with Hydron Plus subscription, or your core subscription. Failing? I don't think, though, it's going to fail. Sir, upload option was failing, no?

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Maybe only for one people, maybe you can try now. It should not fail.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Yeah, obviously you can't upload, like, a… we have put up some of the limit over there, so if your file size is very, very big GB of TV of file, then it will not work.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Yeah? Are we wrapping for today? Not at all. One more hour to go with my lecture, and then route clearing.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Imagen is not working. Imagen will work if you will select the image option. In the bottom image options, you have to select it. Again, for a web search, real-time web search, you have to select the web search option.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.000
But yeah, I would love to hear your feedback and thoughts on that one.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:36.000
You are not able to upload the small file, then we'll check. So, uh, we'll check the option.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:45.000
But yes, it should work. It's one of the stable systems that we have, and it should work all the time, day and night, 24 by 7.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:51.000
And if we are facing any issues, obviously, every system will be having some minor issues. We'll try to fix it in no time.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Working, not working file size 20MB, please fix. Uh, we'll see how much, uh, I think 5MB team has allowed, maybe we can increase the limit.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Yeah, I was able to upload the images. It will work, guys, anyhow, it will work, yeah? Fine. So, uh, what I was trying to say is that we are living in an era of, we are living in an age of AI. So, obviously, even while doing a coding, we have to use a AI.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Now, this is where a Vive coding comes into our picture. I believe some of you must have heard about a Vive coding.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Those who are not aware about a live coding, let's do it, and let's test it.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:41.000
So, see, live coding simply means that you will write some prompt, maybe I have to build a small project, right? I'll show you, I'll show you now itself.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:55.000
So maybe I have to build a small project, and uh… I want an assistance from a system, from an AI, that, okay, let's build a small project from me, from the scratch, right? Maybe for a UI, for a front-end, back-end, all those things.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Uh, maybe I have an existing project, right? I have some project on a GitHub.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:15.000
And, uh, or maybe somewhere in my local. And I want an AI to explain me that project, or, like, create a README file, create a complete project documentation, maybe a PRD, maybe HLD, maybe LLD for me.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Right? So now, at least we are living in an era where AI will be able to do some of these tasks easily.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Yeah, some of these tasks easily. Now, you must be having a curiosity, or you must be having caution in your mind, that, okay, so if AI is able to write all the code.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Then do we need a developer? Do we need a people?

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Yes, we do need. Even after hundreds of years, and believe me, doesn't matter what people are saying, but yeah, so you can go and, like, uh.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Talk to those people who are actually building. I have seen, like, uh, you know, on a social media.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Uh, people are talking a lot about these things, but when I check their background, and when I, like, check, like, what they have built so far, uh, I was not able to find out for majority of people. And those who are building, they are busy with building, so they're not saying anything on social media.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:17.000
So, all those buzz has been created by a majority of the people. I'm not saying everyone is fake, but yeah, the majority of the people who have not built even a single thing, they just have only one skill, and that skill is to, you know, speak something in a polished way, so that people will believe.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:23.000
And this is the reality of the social media, and it's nothing new, right? We are not kidding. We all understand that part.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:34.000
But yeah, believe me, a developer will be required, architect will be required, solution designer will be required, even after hundreds of years, because if you will see the last three decades, right, last.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:50.000
1990s, then 2000, then after 2010. And, like, almost the fourth decade we are into, right? We are into 2025. So almost into our fourth decade, uh, since the IT revolution, a major IT revolution. There was IT even in 80s, but yeah, it was very less. It was in a very, very initial stage.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:59.000
So, we are almost in a fourth decade, and you must have seen, or if we'll go and do a Google search, or maybe you must have seen in the movies.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:09.000
That things are evolving, right? So, the things that we are able to use it easily nowadays, just example, like, mobile phone.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:16.000
It was… people was not able to even… able to imagine it in 1990s, right? We were literally… so we are… we are basically 90s born.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Right. So, we were literally had to go to a PCO booth, and then from there, we have to, like, give a call, and it's not like, even Landline was common in all the household, at least in my house, there was more landlines. So we had to go to a PCU, and then from there, we have to, like, a… Give a call to someone, and per minute we have to pay, like, a heavy amount. So we were able to talk only for 1 or 2 minutes.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:59.000
How are you? And then, like, people say, I'm good, and then it's done. So things has evolved a lot, right? Things has evolved a lot. And similarly, we have ended up generating a new problem, whether it's an environmental problem, or whether it's a problem in our society, or whether we are, like, planning to, like, you know, establish our colonies on a Mars, or maybe on a moon.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:07.000
So, our problem has even changed. A lot. Right? A lot. And even we are able to do a lot of evolution.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:12.000
So it's not like… and this is something that has been done by a human.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:33.000
And see, uh, AI, right? So, AI always works based on the thought I'm going to give till a certain extent. It will not be able to think that, okay, fine, this is required, that is required, let's do this, let's do that. In majority of the cases, and even going forward, so as we will keep on evolving, we will keep on generating a new, new, new, new problem.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:38.000
So, in one single thought, AI will not be able to solve it. That's the first part. Second part is that.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:44.000
That you will not be able to build an AI, right? You will never be able to build an AI, basically.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Which can develop an end-to-end system with every kind of a security, every kind of a feature, every kind of facilities that we are looking for. The reason is very simple. Ai just understands a pattern. Whatever pattern it has learned with the data that we've fed into the AI system.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:12.000
It is able to generate, right? It is able to generate. That's the reason, so we say it's a generative AI. It generates, right? But generates based on what? Whatever pattern that we have fed.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Yeah? Whatever. Yes, to a certain extent, it will be able to understand even a new pattern, but on an accuracy side, we have a doubt. So again, same goes with the vibe coding, that with the vibe coding, because we are using it, my entire team is using it. So, obviously, it is able to enhance our capabilities.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Even, like, when we were writing our code before AI era, two and a half year back.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:53.000
So, it's not like we were not building a system. We were building a system, a lot of systems we have built, and even at that point of a time, it's not like we were writing a code from the scratch. No, we were reusing our own codebases, we were, like, uh… looking into someone's GitHub repository, we were looking into a stack overflow, and we were writing a code. We were developing a system.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Now, the only matter of fact is that, that I have a smart, intelligent.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Basically assistant I am able to get with the help of AI, right? Which is going to, obviously, like, enhance my frequency, I would say, and which is going to give me additional power, additional capabilities.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Where, instead of 10 developer, maybe if you are one very, very good developer, very good one. Again, very good one, not an average one.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:31.000
So, very good developer? Yes, instead of 10 people, alone you will be able to build some product, yeah? Not a complete product, I would say, which can go for the scale and, you know, which can do everything, but yeah, at least.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Till MVPs, it's very, very easy now. And this is what we have seen in the last three decades, right? Things are becoming easier.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:44.000
So, I have given you the example of mobile phone and connectivity, right? So, yeah, connectivity was difficult. Now, it's very easy.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Similarly, writing a code was difficult, now it's getting easy, easier, easier, and easier, right? But yeah, we are falling into a new problem statement as well.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:04.000
So, uh, basically, uh, here, we have our ID, I hope, I hope all of you are able to understand the context of our AI, what I'm talking about.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:10.000
So, here, in terms of AI, so I can try to use something called as Vive coding.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:29.000
And there are multiple tools which is available in our market now. One of the famous one is Cursor. I'm not promoting cursor, by the way, but yeah. So, C-U-R-S-OR, just try to search for a cursor, uh, one of, uh, even recently, Google has announced Google, like, uh, Fire, uh.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Your Google Firebox, I think. I'm not able… Fire, sorry, Fire… no, not Fire Call, Firefox.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Will have announced. Not able to recall the exact name, but yes.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Even from a Google, you will be able to find out, but yeah, cursor is… fire is, yes, got it.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:52.000
There is fire crawl, there is a Firebase… yeah, it's a Firebase, basically. Uh, so, uh, here, uh, you will be able to find out a cursor, one of the most popular one.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:58.000
The second most popular which I see in a market is called as Windsurf, W-I-N-D-S-U-R-F, Windsurf.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Which is a direct competitor of this one. Now, both of these guys have done what?

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:11.000
So the VS Code that you have installed today, right? A VS Code on top of it, they have built their own wrapper, they have built their own agents, basically.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:20.000
They have attached a AI models, for example, a GPT model, Gemini model, CloudA model, Cloud A Sonid, they have applied over there.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:28.000
So that, just with the help of your command, it will be able to generate a code for you, which I'll show you right now, yeah, which I'll show you right now.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Plus, cursor is giving you, even when surf is giving you some free tier, so you can do an experimentation. So, do a very simple thing, guys. Download, yeah? Download for Windows, if I'm using a Windows machine, if you are using a Mac machine.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:47.000
It is going to give you an option for a Mac as well as for a Linux. So, it's available for all the machines.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:53.000
So just download it, and again, installation is very quick. I have already opened up my cursor, let me close it.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Yeah? So, just execute. So, cursor is already available in my system, by the way, yeah? Accept the agreement, next, next, next, and done. Let me ping you the link, by the way, guys, for a cursor.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:17.000
So, this is a cursor. Open up. Download and install. Now, this cursor.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Is going to help you out directly, without even, like, asking Yuri or ChatGPT or Gemini. This cursor is going to help you out directly to, you know.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Write a code. In terms of wildcoding. These are paid ones. Everyone is a paid one. They are giving you some free tiers, basically.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:41.000
A company laptop will not allow, yes. So, if you're using company laptop, so you have to ask for a permission from your admin.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:49.000
I'm not saying that it's for everyone. Those who are blocked, basically, because majority of the company gives you a laptop, and they block the.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Additional installation, and if you're looking for some additional installation, you have to, like, you know, go with the admin permission. So, you can, you should go and ask your admin.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:04.000
If you would like to use it. Otherwise, use the existing one.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Fine, guys, yes? Okay.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:16.000
So, uh, GitHub, there are so many options nowadays. Again, for a cursor and windsoft, right, so there are, like, 10 other options which is available.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:25.000
But again, products are if half-cooked or half-baked. So, in that case, you will feel frustrated in terms of using it.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Right? We'll use another LAPI then. Yes, yeah.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Because otherwise, you can go to… go and check with your admin. Majority of times, your admin will allow, so.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:43.000
They won't be having any kind of issue, because you are not installing anything suspicious. It's a ID, just an additional ID.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Yeah? Colab could we use? You can use anything that you want, but yeah, so you, like, uh, depends upon your convenience. My personal choice, I'm talking about over here, your personal choice could be different, but yeah, try this out, maybe your personal choice will change.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Simple, yeah? Now, so cursor… Download it, install it, just like a VS Code, a no-hustle kind of a system, again. So, where you will not find any issues.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Now, again, open up CURSOR, search for the cursor, so maybe in your Mac system or Linux, or maybe into your Windows, search for the cursor.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Now, I'll show you a live coding, a flavor of Wive coding. We'll do a lot, it's just my first class, right? Technical class. Uh, we are going through.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:37.000
So, you will be able to find out, let me close my existing, like, project. So, uh, and let me open up a fresh folder over here. So, you will be able to find out this interface.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Which is similar, which is similar to the VS Code that you have installed. Because, technically.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Karsar is our VS Code, right? Vs Code, like I said, it's an open source project by Microsoft.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:16:05.000
And many people, so even if you have seen in my previous company, so we have created a lab, a complete lab. So, where you don't have to do any kind of installation in a local machine, you just have to click Label Spin, and then you will be able to write a full-fledged code.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:20.000
I'm not saying that just like a Jupyter notebook, kind of. No, full-scale code. The way you are writing it over here, so even we have done the same thing back then. I think two and a half years back, I have built that project, and I have launched it in my previous company, and people have literally loved it.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Right? Literally, they have loved it. Uh, I don't know, in Urolab, exactly. So, people who are coming from the past, they remember that, right?

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Uh, so we have, we have built it, so we have even modified the VS Core, because VS Code is an open source project, so everyone, even WindSelf, right? Another one which I told you.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:44.000
So even if you'll go through a winter, Windsoft is doing the same thing, like, they are modifying, uh, the same VS Code.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Right? So don't go and build, like, uh, things from the scratch. They just, like, use the VS Code, and then, obviously.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:17:00.000
A lot of agents, lot of wrapper, they have built it on their own. That's the reason it's working in that way, right? Okay, so here, open up a cursor, guys. Now, I'll go to File.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Same as VS Code, right? Open folder, and then let's suppose I'm going to create a test VIB, test drive.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Yep, so let's do a test wave coding. So, created a test vibe folder, select a folder.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.000
And, uh, as of now, there is nothing, right? There is nothing.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:25.000
There is nothing in this one. And on your right-hand side, yeah, on your right-hand side, you will be able to see.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Let me show you that. So, on your right-hand side, you will be able to see this new chat option. If you're not able to see it.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Click, click. This panel. Just follow my mouse cursor, red dot, yeah, red dot.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Uh, it's easy peasy kind of a thing. So click, click. So, you will be able to see a new chat option, yeah? New chat option.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:50.000
And, uh, here, so you will be able to see an agent ask, background, all those things here.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:18:00.000
You will be able to see all the models. If you are going to click on Auto, by default, I believe when you install, it will be on auto by default, yeah? Auto means model selection, it will do automatically.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:09.000
If you are going to, like, you know. Hide it, then it will show you the model it is using. So, it is using, basically, Cloud SONet 3.503 Gemini, GP, this, this, this.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:19.000
And you can add your own model as well. For example, uh, so there, let's suppose they're charging you, right? Obviously, after a certain limit.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:33.000
They are going to charge you, right? They are going to ask for $20, and maybe, like, their max plan is, I think, for $100, I believe. So, here, you can try to add even Yuri API key. But yeah, URI API key, we are giving you 1 lakh per day.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:39.000
So, it will be exhausted very soon, within 5-10 minutes, it will be exhausted. If you are generating a code.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:44.000
But there is a possibility that you can even give an access.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:55.000
So technically, see, this is the IDE. It will be having an AI model access, right? So, as you can see, it is having a Cloud A4 sonet, 3.5 Sonet, 03 Gemini. Gpt 4.140.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Now, if you will go and check… Right, if you'll go and check Iran, so even inside a uran, inside a URI, you have those model axes, right? And for the same model, we have given you APIs. So, see.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:14.000
4.0 Mini 4.1, you have an access, actually, right? You have an access, and even inside the API, if you will go and check.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:23.000
So we have given you those actions. So I have labeled models, uh, let me, let me, let me go to introduction, and then OpenAI. These model access you have with the API, right?

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:33.000
So, it is possible, and cursor is giving you an option where you can try to attach your own model, maybe an open source model, which you are running in a local, or maybe you are running on a cloud.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:39.000
So, it is possible to attach, uh, like, a URI API over here, uh.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:42.000
So that you don't have to go and give, like, a $20, by the way, yeah?

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Uh, but again, one lakh is a daily limit that we have given to you. So, it will not be, like, possible to build an entire.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Project out of it, because API comes with the cost, and we are giving you 365 lakh.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:09.000
For an entire year, right? Because whatever you buy from Euron, you are having, like, a 365 days of access, so it's the 365 lakh, so it is already costing us a bomb.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Right? We are planning to bring some, like, a plan, I don't know whether I will launch that or not, where… on paper-use basis, if someone is looking for additional API, they can go ahead and, like, use it.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:34.000
But yeah, I'm just thinking on that, like, a pricing model, basically. Because I don't want to, you know, go high on my course prices, so you're on plus prices, basically. So that's the reason. And API is technically giving us a lot of cost.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:44.000
So here, right, uh, this is basically a chat prompt, or chat window, so where you can write something, and it is going to take a help of those AI model.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:55.000
That you see in the market, right? That you see in a market, that you see inside the UD. Because at the end of the day, this is the browser, this needs an access of the model, and cursor never, ever… they have trained.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Or are released their own model. They are using all the model from outside. Same goes with the windsurf. They have not created their own model.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:11.000
And the same goes with even Iran. We have never created, we have never claimed that we have fine-tuned or we have created any model. No, we are giving you.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Access of those world-class model. This is what we say. Yeah, this is what we say.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Those companies won't restrict you, sir, which company? No, we are paying, right? Obviously, which company is going to restrict me? Because, uh, proprietary model-wise, I'm using an OpenAI model. I'm paying for that, right?

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:42.000
We are paying for an API, basically. So, why they will, like, restrict me? And then, like, whatever model which is an open source model, so we have hosted it on our platform, on our GPUs, right? We are doing inferencing from there.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:54.000
So, who will restrict me? And what is the reason behind that? Nothing, right?

01:21:54.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Yep. Okay, so now, right? Now, uh, let's talk about this cursor. So, basically, like I said, so this cursor is again a VS Code that you have already installed. Install now, new update.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Fine. And, uh, it is going to help you out in terms of doing a live coding. So… Let's do one live coding. So, let's suppose I'm, like, a person.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Who is not available about a coding at all means, literally, I'm zero. I'm absolute zero in coding, I don't understand coding.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Right? And still, I will be able to build… not a big one, I would say, but a very, very small project, yeah?

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:38.000
So, any idea, guys, you can give? So, what kind of a project? A small one, just give me the small, small idea.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:54.000
That's a random one. I'll show you the power of IP coding, by the way. Calculator is, like, everyone does that. I can even ask Yuri and… it'll be done. React app, to-do app, okay, email generation, stop loss, TikTok. Tiktok is also, like, it's a small game.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Give me, give me something, something unique, something unique. Neural language to SQL. That is also, like, a very easy Facebook app, uh, yeah, UI-wise, medical chat, but again, stock price prediction, scam email.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Travel planner application, okay? People, now they're giving, like. Dial plan, face recognition, your own platform… no, your own platform is the wrong way. Like, see, the very big one, it will not be able to generate anyhow.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Right. Uh, price, uh.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:36.000
Freelancing website, okay. Train booking system… Okay, I'm looking for some interesting, like, because one I'll pick.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Stock prediction, blog, how to convert language, train booking system, ATM hacking, okay? Convert image to PDF to validate data into Excel sheet, quiz app.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Rip, or YouTube text, blog, IPL match, ticket booking. Okay, let's, uh, uh, build IPL match ticket booking, yeah?

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Let's how we do it. I'll salvage sake, take something else.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Ssc exam.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Okay, so basically, here, I'm… see, I'm completely blank, I'm going after your suggestions, so whatever suggestion that you have given.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Instaboost poster weather prediction, ticket booking system, uh, team meeting summarizer, okay.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:33.000
No, I would like to, like, build something with a UI and backend both.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Yep, document version, we can practically test also. Yeah, practically we can test everything, by the way. Okay, so let's go ahead and, uh, let's try to, like, uh… build one project. You can, you can build on your own thoughts, right? But let me, like, uh… and let's imagine that I'm not going to write even a single line of code here, not even a single line of a code, even if it is going to give me an error.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:09.000
I'll just try to ask an ID to solve that error, and do the iterations for me, and build a best project for me, yeah? So, I am planning to build.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Planning to build. Or, one more approach, uh, which I used to follow, right? So, the approach which I used to follow is that, that, let's suppose I'm going to Uri, yeah? I'm going to Yuri. I have selected maybe any model, maybe even Gemini, I can try to select. Gemini 105 Pro.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:36.000
So, I am… I'm planning to… Planning to build a… IPL, ticket.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Booking system. Uh, write all the… basic, initial… features for me, and along with this.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Gave me a… Complete… system… design, and it's… 11th component for… uh, me.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:17.000
And use, uh… tech stack.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Moan, or maybe I'll say, like, a… Python for backend, and then… use any… for… front end. Okay, so basically, I've written something, right? So, just a rough note I have written, and just I'm asking a Gemad 1.5 Pro.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:50.000
That, okay, so just give me a rough idea, and give me all the features around this entire thing. This is what I have asked, and let's see. So, Gemini Pro should give me some idea.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:59.000
And I will be using that idea.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Yeah, so it has started giving me, as you can see, like, some ideas with respect to my MVPs, that, okay, you should have this feature, that feature. And like I said, let's imagine that I'm new, right? I'm completely new to a system.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Which I'm trying to build, and I literally have no idea that what kind of a feature I should do, uh, what feature I should not do, and people have given me many, like, options, right? Uh, many options, many platforms to build.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:33.000
So, first of all will be the ideation phase. So, where I would like to understand that if I'm trying to build, and this is how every project moves, if I'll talk about the POC and MVPs.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:41.000
That, okay, so I'll try to do an investigation. Now, investigation is pretty much easy now, right? So, previously, we do, like, a lot of, like.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Competitor comparison as well, that how their platform looks like, what they're providing, what they're not providing.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:55.000
But now we have our AI, and even inside our AI itself, we can do those comparisons. So, I've just asked that, okay, fine, so I'm trying to build an IPL ticket booking system.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Now, for this MBPs, they give me something. So, a user-facing feature will be match, uh, match listing and filtering, interactive stadium seat map, uh, seat selection and booking.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Uh, booking time, user authentication, secure payment, ET card generation, notification, right? Admin-facing. So there will be a user-facing, admin-facing, from where you will be able to control everything. So this should be the feature, initially, I should give inside the admin-facing.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:41.000
This is the system design architecture, so there will be an entry point, web browser, there will be entry point from while app, and maybe API, through API. All will go inside a CDN, so which will distribute my entire traffic. Basically, it will go inside the API gateway, and then there will be a multiple service I can create. So, user service, match service, booking service, payment service, notification service, right? And everyone is going to hit, eventually, a SQL.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Now, I understand these things, by the way. I understand these terminology, but maybe many of us won't understand, right? Won't understand.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:29:02.000
That's again fine, right? That's again fine. So, here, right, so here it has given me a skeleton. Now, what I do, right, in terms of doing a live coding, I'll just copy the user interfacing part.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Let's not build the admin part as of now. I'll just copy it.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:13.000
I'll just paste it here. It has generated the complete plan, copy and paste. I don't know what I'm pasting, by the way. I have just copy and pasted, let me keep it in an auto mode.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Yeah? Copy and paste it. Now… Click. And now see the magic. Avive coding.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:33.000
Simple. So, go to AI, generate the entire plan, bug in if you think that something is missing, re-prompt it, and ask the correct question that, okay, fine, so do this, do that for me. Uh, maybe this is missing.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:42.000
And it will start doing it. Now, once your plan is ready, once you know that what you have to create on a user side, on an admin side, an operations side, everything, right?

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:48.000
Uh, once your plan is ready, and just in one prompt, right? Just in my very first prompt, I have not even done the second prompt.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Simple. I have not even done the second prompt. Maybe second, third. I can refine a lot, right? Same thing, I will be able to refine the lot.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:30:10.000
So, go to Yuri, give your prompt, and… check. Now, as you can see, it has started creating a project for me. I can even tell this, that, okay, use this technology stack, and it will be using only that technology stack.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:18.000
And it is a using, basically, like a Monstack, right? And, uh, most of us don't even understand.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Please show the prompt in Yuri. Which prompt? Go ahead and give your own prompt, right? I think, why do you need… My prompt.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Remember, I have given some rough prompt with a lot of spelling mistakes and lines and, like, I don't know about the grammar, so there must be a lot of grammatical mistake.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:51.000
We have AI, so it is able to understand everything and then, like… It is able to do it. I can even share this entire page with you. Let me share this entire same page, right? You can, like, check this out.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:56.000
This URI page. So inside a URI, we have a share option.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:06.000
So I don't have to, you know, copy-paste it. You can see in the exact same manner, the manner I'm able to see it inside URI.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:13.000
Okay, so let's go back to the cursor. It's working for me, it's like, uh, writing a code.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:20.000
A lot of code it is trying to write.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:34.000
So, it will take time, maybe, like, a 15-20 minute of time sometimes. Sometimes it takes even a… for a small project, I would say. Sometime, uh, for me, from my personal experience, it takes even an hour, maybe sometimes 2 hours of time, because it will give you a bug, maybe.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:44.000
It has created something which you don't want, so you have to, like, go ahead and you have to, like, write a prompt again, you have to do a lot of iterations. Sometimes you have to go into a code and say that, okay, fine, change this line.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:50.000
And this is where developer is required. And I'm talking about just this kind of a small project, right?

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:57.000
See, I'm trying to show you a vibe coding, so that you will be able to understand that what AI can do, and then what will be my responsibility.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:03.000
So it's not like AI will be able to do everything. So if I'll be having a bug, obviously, I have to understand the code.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:14.000
So my… yesterday, someone was asking me a question that, uh, we are into a generative AI era, right? So, do we need to learn, like, statistics and, you know, machine learning algorithms, those probabilities… probabilistic-based models?

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:24.000
My answer will be always yes, even after 10 years. That you should. Whatever we are able to build today, whether it's a space chip or whether it's, like, anything, rocket.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:30.000
It's on a basic principle, right? And you have to even… even computer. So because of that, computer exists.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:34.000
So, you and anyone who is starting, obviously you have to learn.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Otherwise, you will not be able to build.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Uh, what is the main difference between Copilot and Cursor? Technically, like, uh… A cursor is a full-scale agentic-based system, so where they invoke a lot of agents, they try to maintain a lot of context, they can understand the long, like, long-term memory, and they have given you this CloudSunet access, which is one of the.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Model, which, like, generates a huge amount of the code in one single prompt, means context length is bigger, basically. That's the difference.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Human will be tested, AI will be delivered on a lighter node. Ah, no, not like that. I don't agree with that statement.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:32.000
How we have integrated cursor with VS. No, Cursor has given you the ID, so we have not integrated it, we have just downloaded the cursor from cursor.com.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:41.000
You will say, write the prompt in VS Copilot, asking for Copilot login. Okay, so then log in?

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:54.000
You are the same, yeah, because they have used, like, even for wind surf, if you are going to use a wind surf, right, UI is going to be the same. Even this Firebase, if you are going to use… so, okay, let's this AI generate my code, I'll keep it in my different screen.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:34:04.000
And, uh, let me talk about… because that will take time. Like I said, 15-20 minute time. If I would have given a calculator app kind of application, it would have done that by now.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:11.000
In 30 seconds. But yeah, so I have given some complex applications, so it will take some time. Still, it's working for me. It's generating a code.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Uh, there is something called as Firebase, so even they have used, uh.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:33.000
This VS Code, but yeah, in a browser. So recently, recently means, I think, 3-4 big back, right? Uh, so Google had released this, uh, like, Firebase Studio, which works inside a browser. And if you will see the interface, it's a VS Code interface itself. So, you can go to Firebase.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:39.000
And you can try this out, and you can, like, give a prompt, and from the prompt, it will start generating. For example.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:49.000
Uh, uh, built… uh… modern… calculator app for me with an.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Amazing UI interface. A colorful one.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:12.000
Colorful one, with, uh… team of… Netflix. Fine? It will, it will also work. I can select a technology from here. So, like I said, Google Firebase Studio, and basically, it's, uh, you can invoke it inside a browser itself.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:21.000
So there is no installation, no download is required. It's working. And here is my cursor. See how hard it is working for me.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:27.000
Very, very hard, right? Writing a lot of code for me. My concern is still working.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:37.000
It is creating, like, a one-by-one everything. And again, so Firebase Studio.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:51.000
So, just imagine where we have, like, a moved now. I'm just trying to show you that flavor, that where we have moved now. And just imagine, if I'm going to open up one single file, right? If I'm going to open up one single file.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:58.000
You will be amazed that, okay, if I'm going to ask some human being to write the same thing, right, the basic one, the template one.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:02.000
The skeleton one, you can say. How much time it will take? And for AI.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:08.000
See? Yeah. So my AI assistant is working.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:19.000
And I don't even understand the code. You are really a hardcore coder with prompt. Yeah, anyone can become now.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:27.000
So, see, it was never about a coding, I would say. See, it was even, uh, like, a 5-year back, 10-year back, right?

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:34.000
It was always about a product, the mindset and the business use cases, the user problem you were able to solve.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:46.000
As simple as that. So, it was relevant 5-year, 10-year, or 20-year back, and it is relevant even now. Tech was just a substitute, tech was just a bridge.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Which was trying to give a user and a business a convenient, a lot of convenience. This is where only text comes into a picture.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:59.000
But, uh, it was always about the idea, a thought process, and a problem.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:08.000
And people who will be able to, like, you know, generate an idea, they will be able to solve a new problem of a modern age. Believe me.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:20.000
They will always be relevant. There will always be relevant, literally, they will always be relevant.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Uh, but still, we have a coding interview. Yeah, but I think almost all the big companies, right, even Meta, if you'll go and check the news.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:33.000
So, Facebook kind of a company, they are allowing you to use AI in an interview directly.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:49.000
So, AI-based this kind of IDE, right? Because they wanted to understand your approach, your thought processing. For example, someone has asked me that generate IPL ticker booking. So, obviously, I have just given this prompt to my AI, and then it has given this skeleton, I will again chat, I will try to ask for the edge cases, I will try to ask for the security measures.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:56.000
I'll be looking for all this tools. Now, based on my experience, right, I have seen that with other tools, so I will be doing the same thing over there.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.000
So this is where now companies are looking for. And plus.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:06.000
If AI has generated a code, right, and if someone is going to ask me a question that explains me this piece of code, the selected one, right?

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:11.000
I should be in a position to explain this one immediately.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:21.000
So, AI is writing a code, that's completely fine, right? But if someone is going to ask me to execute and explain me this code, right, or maybe add some feature, maybe a small feature into this one.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:27.000
As a developer, I'm supposed to do it. If I'm not able to do it, then there is no use of using an AI.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Simple.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:52.000
Okay, still working. Let me check my Firebase… okay, what happened to my Firebase studio? It is not working.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:58.000
Okay, so Firebase Studio is taking a lot of time. So, bad user experience, by the way.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:08.000
And my cursor is, like, working very hard, so good user experience.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Files are automatically created? Yeah, I can just ask a question that, okay, fine, so try to do a modular, keep it modular, and, like, keep all the files separate.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:23.000
It will be created automatically. Again, for the Python. Even it will be able to do an execution, and it will be able to test it, by the way.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:29.000
So that is also possible.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:40.000
Please run the execution. Do I need to run the execution? Because it's showing me this flashy things, uh… Which, uh, needs to be, like, you know.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Sorted, okay. So, let me rename. I never… I don't use Firebase frequently, so… not frequently, I would say. I never used to create any project, because.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:40:00.000
A cursor is more than enough for me. And you just need one AI, so…

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:03.000
I don't know what it is trying to create, but yeah.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:12.000
We'll build a modern age with an… Amazing UI.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:21.000
Calculator.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:28.000
Yeah, he will do it. Hmm, started creating my calculator.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:39.000
The Firebase Studio. Yeah, write the app.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:46.000
Can you ping the Firebase Studio? Uh, yeah, I can do it. Uh, here is the one.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:41:03.000
Yeah, so this Firebase is working, and hopefully my… Keep all, okay? So, all is done, okay, fine. Complete the eyeball mesh. Okay, so now, as you can see, that it is able to build the entire system, and core feature implemented, match listing and filtering.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:20.000
Interactive stadium setup map, seat selection and booking, book timer, 10-minute countdown, use authentication profile, this, this, this, this, this, so all of this. Technical stack, front-end-wise, it has selected, uh, Next.js, React, and TypeScript. Uh, for styling, for, like, UI, so it has selected, uh, Tailwind CSS for database, Postgres.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:31.000
And Prism ORM, authentication-wise, Next.js Auth. Payment system-wise, Stripe, it is using. I can ask them to, like, integrate a PayPal, it will do it. Upi, it will do it.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:41.000
Uh, like a Rosal pay, it will do it. Real-time, socket I.O. It is using for the real-time communication. Email handle-wise, so NodeMail it is using, QR code-wise, QR code library. Now, databases, schema-wise, it has created already.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:45.000
Now, sample data, it has already put the sample data, right?

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:54.000
Now, I have to do what? So, I have to basically… it has given me a setup, it has… it has basically given me a command by which I will be able to execute it.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:42:05.000
And the fun part is, I have not written even a single line of code throughout this entire thing, right? Now, so… set up a database, I'll just ask. So, do one thing, do one thing for me.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Execute. Execute, test, and… debug for me. So I'm a very lazy person, by the way. I don't want to, like, you know… Uh, even execute.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:29.000
Or run one single command, not even a npm… command, so… I'll just ask my AI.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Fireless Creator Calculator. Yeah, it will create. It's still creating for me, I don't know why it is taking so much of time.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:43.000
But yeah.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:59.000
Stand up this article, though, sir.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:08.000
Uh, sir, there are much of noise about the AGI. Could you please tell me about it? So, FullForm is artificial general intelligence.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:18.000
When I was trying to, like, understand it, right? So… The only thing which I was able to understand that, okay, people are trying to attach some sort of, you know, a wrapper on top of this one, so that they can control it.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:28.000
They can put a lot of, like, uh, gargil over there, they can give more control to a human being, because there are a bunch of a group of people, you can say, so who are afraid.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:35.000
Uh, that, uh, going forward, so AI should not take over a human being. Uh, so this is where this, uh.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:44.000
Whole concept of AGI is coming into a picture for now. Maybe that definition will change in the future.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Would it really impact the employment? See, this code, if you are going to ask a developer to write, so maybe you need two, three people, and you have to give at least three to four weeks of time.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:44:04.000
At least to create this boilerplate, right? I'm not saying, like, a full scale. Obviously, to make it fuller scale, to add a lot of things on top of this one, you… need a real developer.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Right? But at least for… see, auth system, again, common everywhere. All those, like, elements, common everywhere. Chad system, common everywhere, right?

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:16.000
So, yeah, you can do it, AI can do it easily, right?

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:27.000
And now it is testing my things, I have just given one bad command, do one thing, uh, for me, execute, test, and debug for me. So it is, it is like, uh, executing, running, installing.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:37.000
Uh, so see, npm install, it is doing installation automatically. I'm not even, like, trying to install this one.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:55.000
Nothing so simple. Open up your terminal. So, see, this entire cursor ID is your VS Code, so click over here, new terminal. Now, from this new terminal, type git INIT, and then create a repository, push it. I'll show you that. Just wait. Wait for, like.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:59.000
It will take, like, a 30 second of time for me to push on a GitHub repository.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:04.000
Just 30 seconds. So, once will be test, like, good. It is, like, running the code.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:09.000
I'm fixing the bug, as you can see. See? Everything has been done by itself.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:16.000
I just wanted to see the final flavor.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:24.000
For using a cursor, do we need to log in? Yeah, I think after some time, right, you will end up exhausting your free quota.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:32.000
Then they will ask you for a login, and then they will ask you for a payment as well.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:52.000
Cicd pipeline. We can do everything. Just… imagination is the limit, believe me, in the age of AI. And hope all of you are able to… Uh, those, those who have not seen that, right, so… you will feel amazed, believe me, you will feel amazed. And that's the reason why I'm showing you that what AI can do, so that going forward, when we learn.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:46:05.000
Our mindset should be very much aligned. That let's build a big thing. Do not stick ourselves towards just a small learning.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Have you used a cloudy code? I mean, like, it's not a Cloudy code, uh, I have used so many times, like.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Yeah, it depends what application I'm looking into.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:36.000
You said I'm that kind of a lazy person who can't run the code even… I mean, like, I'm just behaving… I said that I'm behaving like a lazy person as of now, yeah? So that I can show you that what AI can do. I don't want to…

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Like, run my code even, so I just ask my AI that, okay, do it for me, and… So I'm just trying to show you the capability of AI.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:55.000
So, why are you coding, right? I have already mentioned, see, now it's starting the database, clean the existing data, creating a team, it has, you know, tested each and everything, it has basically, like, uh.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:04.000
Fixed all the bugs, because yes, there was a bug, and I can see in a log that it was trying to fix all of those bugs, so I can see over here that it was trying to fix all of these bugs.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:22.000
And now, uh, it is starting. So, starting a database seeding. Now, excellent, now let me start the development server. Okay, amazing. So now it is starting the development server for me.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:41.000
We recently had a scenario of a replay that had a concern of production and dev environment, so what is your opinion? We are the company? See, this is the reason you need a developer. Blindly, whatever code it has created, you can't trust, right? You should not expose your vulnerable part, maybe a port or any.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:47.000
Like, uh, any credentials which may give an access to some XYZ system to enter in your system.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:55.000
So this is where you need a real developer. That's the reason I'm saying live coding is just behaving like your helper, your assistant.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:48:06.000
Right? You need a real developer, a good one, actually. A better-than-before kind of a developer.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:14.000
I think debuggers are more required. Not debuggers. Even a person who can… you see, I always appreciate… see.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:21.000
Whenever we build even a real-time application, right, 80% of the time, most of the time, most of the project, 80% of the time goes in the debugging.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:29.000
So that's a real skill. And, uh, basically, if you're able to debug anything, it simply means that you understand the whole code base, right?

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:33.000
Let me check the server is running using a power cell.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Invoke request? Okay, so at 3000 port local host, let me check.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:45.000
And, uh, see, guys, what we are able to build with the help of Vive Coding.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:51.000
I think it looks amazing, right? Yes?

01:48:51.000 --> 01:49:05.000
Template to build, 2 hours to build. See, these are the names, these are the things that we use to get on our social media, which we should not believe. That's the reason I keep on saying that. There are so many people who try to give a GAN over a social media, and most of the people have not even tried building anything.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:12.000
Right? Not even a simple application. And they're giving us. So, it's not like a thumb rule that, uh.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:17.000
C once, and then apply everywhere. No, not at all. Development doesn't work in that way.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Yeah? So, see, and if I'm going to ask that, and see, I have taken a random project.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:33.000
Right? Random project, I went to AI, I have asked for all the requirements, I was not aware about a requirement, what I should, like, build, basically, as an IPL ticket booking system.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:45.000
So AI has given me requirement, I have just copied and pasted those requirements, asked, waited for some time, asked it to do a debugging and testing and installation and everything, right? And finally, we are able to get something like this.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:51.000
And see, IPL ticker booking. And here. All these features are available to me, right?

01:49:51.000 --> 01:50:07.000
All this feature, I can book a seat, slot buys. I'm able to, like, see it. I can apply a filter, I can search based on the teams, right? So, Raistan Royals, Punjab, King Sun, all those things. Venu-wise, I can try to, like, select over here, Mohan Bagan.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:15.000
Rate range I can try to filter out, right? There are some bugs, obviously. I can ask that to, like, you know, show me all of these things without even highlighting, in a drop-down.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:19.000
And it will be able to do it, yeah? It will be able to technically.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:25.000
Do it for me.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Right? Yeah? So, this is the power of AI. Again, so sign up for wise.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:49.000
Which is very common across all the platforms, right? Whatever platform you're going to create. Uh, so it is able to create the entire sign-up. It will be able to attach to my DB, and then finally, I'll test it, I'll try to add… see, this is the basic feature that it has built. It's not a very advanced feature, right? In a real time, when you will go.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:51:05.000
There are a lot of educators which comes into a picture, so as a business stakeholder, I am supposed to aware about those age cases. Believe me, right? This is a very, very, very, very… still a basic one, I would say. It's not at all an advanced one.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:15.000
Yeah? Not at all advanced one. And believe me, not real time. So this is where a real developer, a real architect, a real people comes into a picture, and I keep on saying.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:33.000
That, uh, although we are able to generate this, which is a boilerplate code, I still say that this is just a boilerplate code, right? Developers are good ones, not a beginner one. And that's the reason, so people have stopped hiding someone who say that, uh, I know this language, I know that language. No. That part is gone now.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:40.000
Right? And if company is hiring, maybe in a very near future, within 6 months of time, uh, that will be gone.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:51.000
So, you should know that, okay, how I can use 10 different, different tools, I understand the code, right? 10 different if we do, I can build faster, I can explain faster, I can debug faster.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Right? I can move faster. Time has gone where you go to the company for an interview and say that I'm a person who is very good with the learning, right? I'm a quick learner. No one is going to buy that line now.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:08.000
Believe me, no one is going to buy that line, that I'm a good learner, because a definition of learning itself has changed.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:17.000
The learning which was taking, like, maybe one year of time, and the same thing I will be able to learn maybe just in a month of time.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:25.000
Yes, yeah? So, I'll keep on showing you, but yeah, so this is my example of a live coding, and you can use cursor, you can use WinSuff.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:31.000
And let me check my fire… okay, so it has… it has done something. Uh, Firebase Studio.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:42.000
Yeah, so it has done something like, uh, is it a modern calculator? I don't know, like… Okay, calculate the age inside. So maybe I have to give a prompt, more prompt.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:50.000
Uh, but yeah, so, uh, this one is, uh, like, you know, is able to build each and everything for me, and it looks amazing. Looks amazing in the first place.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:55.000
I can try to, like, host it, I can try to test it, I can even ask that, okay, add this feature, add that feature.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:53:11.000
And we'll be able to do it. So, just use a cursor, build a couple of things, right, with a cursor, break a couple of things, uh, maybe in Python, or maybe in Java, maybe in C, C++, whatever language, whatever language, whatever framework, whatever database is, right?

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:15.000
That you would like to use, use it. And for idea generation.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:21.000
Use AI for, like, just like me, like, Yuri, or maybe ChatGPT?

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:25.000
Yeah, okay. So, hope all of you are enjoying this class, guys.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Everyone? Yeah? If I can get some, like, something, some comment?

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:35.000
Yes? So, believe me, my classes are not going to be boring. That I can assure.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:41.000
And I will get to know a lot of things, on every level.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:48.000
The ideology part is amazing. Yeah, this is the place we start, by the way. See, if you're going to, like, give this kind of a prompt to your… this one, right?

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Uh, maybe it will not be able to respond back. So, idea generation, and again, we… just our first, like, hand idea.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:54:04.000
It's like, we have to do a lot of iterations. A lot of edge cases.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Sir, we learned GenAI or use this tool. Uh, we learn, actually, Gen AI, so… This tool is just, uh, like, a helper, like I said, even before this, we had a GitHub repository, a lot of GitHub repository, and even before that, we had a stack overflow, right? Where we would code, and then we go to check, uh, go and check.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:29.000
Sir, after 2 hours, give a break. You can take a break, it's fine. I'll do a dout cleaning in between.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:39.000
A great learning and giving a test of the power of your AI. This is just a day… day one, I would say. Study was day zero, so, uh, long way to go.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:44.000
Long way to go, you are going to spend a lot of time with me, uh, so, obviously.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:49.000
Uh, you will see a lot of things, and even I will learn a lot of things from you guys.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:58.000
Can we use cloud? I'll use everything, don't worry. So, just a matter of time. As we'll progress, I'll use everything. Since, at the end of the day, we have to create a full-scale application.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:11.000
So we'll do it. So fine, guys, uh, hope we are good with respect to our local system setup, so we are able to do a local system setup. We also know that, okay, on a cloud, so Google Collab, we can write a code.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:24.000
Uh, we also know that we can do a YU coding with a cursor, with a wind surf, or maybe with the Firebase Studio, and I have already shown you the flavor of, uh… Vive coding, what technically, or what actually Vive coding is.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:32.000
Uh, just one application, I have shown it to you. So, I believe we are good for today's class, and topic-wise.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:44.000
Uh, we are able to cover only this part. Only part number one. So, major framework intro, uh, URI API use. Now, once our system setup is ready, right.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:54.000
Then only I can show you how we can use a Yuri API or other major framework. For example, a Llama Index, a Langchain, an AutoGen, a N8N.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:56:07.000
Because sample integration we have given to you, but I have to show you a small, small use cases and applications, so that you will be able to understand that what is the actual meaning of an agent. When I say agent, right?

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:16.000
What is the meaning of it? We'll create it, and then we'll understand. What is the meaning of a tool? What is the meaning of a memory system? What is the meaning of RHG? All of these things. So, in my upcoming class.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:24.000
This is going to be the agenda. The first one I'm going to cover is a URI API ecosystem, that how you can use a Yuri API, by the way, and then.

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:38.000
I will be covering a major framework introduction, and that framework are basically these frameworks. Langchain, Crew AI, AutoGen, Llama Index, uh, Langraph. So I'll give you intro first, because if you will go through a syllabus.

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:47.000
Everything we have to discuss in detail. The gentleman's literally, like, a lot of details we have to discuss. So, intro first, and then.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:51.000
We will… so once my intro will be done, let me go to a syllabus once again.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:57:04.000
So, now let me tell you where we are. So, basically, we are here, even now, right? Even now. We have not even covered this one, we are trying to cover this particular portion, and uh… We are yet to cover this particular portion.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:20.000
As well, right? So, maybe it will take next Saturday class for me to cover this particular portion, then I'll gradually move into this one, and the next one, the next one.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:25.000
Give me some homework. I will not give you homework now. Homework will come when I'll start discussing your framework.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:32.000
Yeah, as of now, it's fine. Just chill, enjoy, don't take much of pressure, uh, don't get afraid of AI.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:47.000
It's fine. Enjoy your life. Uh, regarding Python Basic, how many lecture we should see, so… we have already uploaded. Uh, try to go till at least, oops, programming goes. I think till, oops, I have uploaded, right?

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:55.000
Okay, only till oops, means, uh, means, means, uh, 30, 31st lecture, yeah?

01:57:55.000 --> 01:58:01.000
Just, just try to cover till that part.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:07.000
I want to build a portfolio page using a VIP code. Yeah, you can do it now itself, within, like, next 5 minutes.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:14.000
Next weekend, we have our Akshabandhan. Yeah, we do have our Akshabandan, but uh… I am not going to give a leave.

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:29.000
To any one of you, uh, basically for Arakshabandan, because I think, like, we can, we can manage, right? So we can… Uh, because even my sister will be here, uh, so I already told them that, uh, please try to come here.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:34.000
After 1 o'clock, so that my class will be over. And I think, uh, we have a time till 2 work log. Muharad buys.

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:45.000
So, till 2 o'clock, you can, like, celebrate Akshaban then. As per the calendar, so… we are not canceling the class. We have a class.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:52.000
When course will complete, um… course, 3-4 months?

01:58:52.000 --> 01:59:10.000
Uh, from today's lab, I feel that, should I not waste my time learning a language nowadays? Yeah, see, you learn fast. This is something which has changed the last two, two and a half years, right? Learn fast. You should not, like, you know, estimate that I will learn in one year, or six months, and then I'll do this, then… No, that time has literally gone.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:17.000
Things have literally changed, so you have to adopt. The modernization. You have to adopt new things.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:31.000
Right? And because once you will start moving fast, right? You will realize that, okay, we have to build a lot, right? We have to build a lot. There are a lot of ideas, there are a lot of thoughts you will be able to get. But yeah, if you'll move slow.

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:46.000
Obviously, uh… It will take time, yeah? So let me close each and everything, guys. Now, so… Those who is not having a doubt, I'm done with my today's class, by the way, yeah? So those who is not having any kind of a doubt, they can drop off.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:53.000
Those who have any kind of a question, uh, for me, like, uh, those who would like to discuss anything with me, so let me lower all the hands.

01:59:53.000 --> 02:00:00.000
Uh, you can raise your hand, so you will be able to see a raise hand option. So, raise your hand. I think we have done that drill yesterday.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:06.000
So we are going to follow the same drill today. Uh, one by one, I'm going to unmute, and then ask the question. I'll try to answer.

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:18.000
Yeah? So, fine, go ahead with the Arman. First, Arman, then Ganesh, then Saeed, then Jubair, then… Ramesh, then Sumes, and then Anil. Yeah, go ahead, please. One by one.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:19.000
And then those are among yourself. You know, I want to vote.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:24.000
Yeah. Yeah, hi, Harman. Yeah, go ahead, please. Yeah, you are audible, yes, yes.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:29.000
Yeah, so now, in the course, you said at one point we have to learn statistics, deep learning, and machine learning.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:30.000
Mm-hmm.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:37.000
So we're taking this Gen AI course at what time we'll be requiring that we have to learn all this MLDL concepts.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:45.000
Uh, see, if timing, I think, see, I can give you a rough estimation, but at the end of the day, it's your time, so you have to spend.

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:51.000
Muslim, at which particular point of time we have to learn that concept.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:52.000
Yeah, by taking this course, by taking this course, I mean.

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:57.000
In… for this… for this course.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:58.000
There's an insecting.

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:07.000
It's not required, actually. As per… as per this course syllabus, it's not required, right? But yeah, so let's suppose, uh, if you would like to, like, understand the entire data science stack with a generative AI.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:19.000
Right? Then, obviously, like, MLDL, so starting from, like, Python, then stats, then machine learning, then deep learning, then computer vision, then NLP, so you have to follow that sequence. Now, that will give you a complete.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:30.000
100% understanding, a practical knowledge, theoretical knowledge, algorithmic knowledge. Mathematical knowledge, uh, about the entire data science tag.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:31.000
Okay, and…

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:42.000
So, you can go in that way. But for this one, it's not required. For this one, machine learning is not a prerequisite. Deep learning is not a prerequisite. Nlp is not a prerequisite. I have just kept only one prerequisite, and that is basic of Python for this one.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:47.000
Okay, so my next question is, like, as you said, you are coming from different, different backgrounds.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:58.000
And at the particular point, you're required to learn different tech stacks. So, what was your approach? Like, for example, you're new to any technology, you don't know anything about that, so how would you start from that, in this age of AI?

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:22.000
See, I'm a… see, not an age of AC, it's my habit, I would say, since a childhood, right? I was not, uh… kind of a student who will go to school and, like, go to college and then take a note of it, and then, you know, obey each and everything which teacher used to say. I was a kind of a student that if school has prescribed NCRT, there was a, like, books published by Bharti Bhavan and Student Friends.

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:35.000
I usually read those books. So I was kind of a, like, an experienced self-learner, uh, since beginning. I was not a very disciplined student in terms of, you know, going to a school, doing all the homework, attending all those exams.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:45.000
But yeah, I do a lot of, like, uh… So, a simple thing which I used to say since many, many years, that before started… before you start learning anything.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:49.000
First, you should learn how to sit on your chair for a very, very long time.

02:02:49.000 --> 02:03:01.000
Right? Because that's the problem with major of us, majority of us. We are not able to sit on the same chair in the same position for a very, very long time, right? And everything requires a dedication, effort.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:22.000
Uninterrupted dedication nowadays in an age of, like, social media. So, where we have a distraction every second. Every second, someone is pinging me, some notification we are going to get, uh, someone is sending me a reel, so… First, remove the distraction, because that's our biggest time killer, and a context switcher, without even realizing.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:29.000
Second thing is, learn how to sit on a chair for the very, very long time, because when you will sit, you will do some work. A real one.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:34.000
Right? That will solve all the problem, then this question will be gone.

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:37.000
That how to learn on new things. You will be able to learn the new things.

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:42.000
Looks at everything has many, many concepts. So for what a person's approach should be.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:48.000
It's not like there are many, many concerts, believe me. It looks like people have given a lot of terms, people have given a lot of, like, uh, you know.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:53.000
So, for example, I'll tell you. So, in your syllabus, I have mentioned, uh.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:58.000
Lamad Langjin, Lama Index, uh, line graph, uh, init, and Autogen, right? Crew AI.

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:06.000
The baseline concept, when you will understand, which I'm going to explain to you, the baseline concept is every framework is helping you out in terms of building an agent.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:14.000
Attaching our tools to it, adding our memories to it, right? And solving and doing some sort of automation.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:21.000
Apart from that, those five frameworks, it looks different, because it has been released by a different company, and it works in a little bit different way, code-wise at least, right?

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:27.000
But under the hood, it is doing approximately a same thing. So, you have to understand the base.

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:34.000
Now, once you understand the base, you will be able to understand all of those 4, 5, or even in future, if 5 companies will come and they will launch.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:39.000
Uh, for example, like, uh… 5 new tools, you will be able to understand.

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:47.000
Cloud, let's suppose, right? Look into your GCP, look into your Azure, look into AWS. It looks like GCP is different, Azure is different, and then AWS is different.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:56.000
Technically, for me, it's not, right? Whatever fundamentals they have implemented in AWS, same is available in Azure, same is available in GCP, with a different name.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:06.000
Problem solved, right? Now, coming to a programming language, right? We say that, okay, Python is simple, or Java is tough, or C++ is tougher, or all those things, right?

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:15.000
Under the hood, if I know one programming language, if I know how it works, right. If I know, like, a looping concept, if that's kind of a concept, approximately.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:20.000
All of those programming languages are doing the same thing. Obviously, syntaxes are different.

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:30.000
Right? So, it looks like we are living in a world where we have too many options, right? But when you are going to club it and think from a 10,000 feet, like, uh, then you will be able to find out.

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:40.000
That it's not too much. It's like, I have never cleared my basic. I was just running after a small, small things, right? All those new things. I was just chasing those, like, things.

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:46.000
And that is the reason I was not able to build the base. And that's the reason I have mentioned, and even today I have mentioned multiple times.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:53.000
That base is required, because that is going to help you out to adopt a new thing. And this is what I have done.

02:05:53.000 --> 02:06:00.000
In my last, like, 11-year career, and even before. Base.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:06.000
Yeah? So… so you have to give a time. See, at least once in your lifetime, you have to give a time to build your complete base.

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:19.000
Maybe it will take 6 months of time, maybe it will take 1 year of time for you, depends upon your caliber, because every human being will be having a… different kind of a capacity, thought process, learning journey. Uh, but yes, if you're able to do it.

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:32.000
For an entire life, you will enjoy. And we have seen that kind of people, and they literally, like, uh… and if you're going to talk to all of those people, almost everyone will say the same thing.

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:33.000
Let's see…

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:54.000
So, clear the base, and then go for the journey. It looks like there are too many things, because now we are living in a world of social media, so anyone is creating even a simple application, they are going for the marketing, and then, like, we all are able to get those budget words, right? And especially in a world of AI, everyday new model, everyday new framework, everyday new startup, but under the hood, most of them are doing the exact same thing.

02:06:54.000 --> 02:07:05.000
Under the hood, most of them, there are only 4 to 5 companies who have created a stable model, right? Which I can actually use. But if you go to Hugging Face, there are millions of all people have published. I'm talking about LLM, only LLM.

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:15.000
Not any other model in any other category. Not a vision model, not text-to-speech, or not, like, any other model, just LLMs, right? There are millions of models which is available, but only 4 to 5.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:23.000
Which I'm using, which cursor you have seen is using, which Windows Office he's using, and which the entire world is eventually using. So it's not too much, it looks like too much.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:26.000
Right? But actually, it's not.

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:36.000
Answer one last question, like, I want our elaboration on that point, like, in this age, how… You should learn fast. So, can you show a practical approach to learn fast, like, related to anything, programming or LLM?

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:40.000
Yeah, join my class, I'll help you out to learn faster.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
But that's a whole deal. Thank you.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:58.000
Okay, Krishna is saying, get a blue screen expert, comfortable gaming chair. Ah, no, I don't like gaming chair. My office chair is way more comfortable than your gaming chair. I have that, actually. I had two gaming chairs, but yeah, I don't like it. Just on a fun note. Yeah, Ganesh, please go ahead with a question.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:07:59.000
So, if you are a, uh, you… URI API that you use.

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:04.000
Yes.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:09.000
The UI API, it… we cannot use in our organization, right? So, what is the alternative for it?

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:14.000
You can… you can use in your organization UDPI. Why you can't use UDP in your organization?

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
It's not your own house. Unique.

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:23.000
No, basically, a URI API, we have two kind of a model. One is a proprietary model, which people have not made as open source, and.

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:30.000
Some of them are open source models, open source models we are hosting. At the end of the day, API-wise, you just need a model calling, right?

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:31.000
You should not worry about, like, uh, from where it is coming from.

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:34.000
Yeah.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:48.000
Basically, you are getting all those international-grade models, a best-of-best model out of those 10 million which exist in the world. And Uri API, this is where Uri API comes into picture. So use it wherever you want for the… application symbol.

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
Okay, the other questions, like, cursors that we download, using the cursors, we are generating the code.

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:55.000
Yep. Mhm. Mm-hmm.

02:08:55.000 --> 02:09:01.000
Well, uh, how it's integrated with VS, like, how it's generating in VS?

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:02.000
That I have many questions you need.

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:11.000
So basically, they have… they have… okay, so basically, in cursor, what they have done, and even you can do it, so basically, they have developed their own extension, so cursor, this interface that you are able to see, right?

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:21.000
So this is their own extension that they have created, and inside that, so they are giving this agent control, a lot of agent, an agent who will be able to summarize the task, an agent who will be able to.

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:44.000
Invoke your entire directory, the agent who will be able to invoke the terminal, agent which will be able to remember all of the memories, agent will be able to basically call all the fallbacks, or which will be able to, like, you know, test a debug, and then it will be able to do the fixes. So there are multiple agent systems, as you can see over here, right? It's a multi-agent system that they have created inside this interface.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:54.000
Uh, and they have integrated with the VS Code, and now they're claiming it as a cursor. And still, they're developing it, they have, like, done a very good job, uh, by the way. So, basically, it's an agentic… a different, different agent calling.

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:57.000
That they are doing. They have written on their own.

02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:06.000
Okay, so the… URI API that we can design, and we can give the command to cursor. Cursor will generate the code.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
That is the chloride.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:14.000
Ud API you can design? No, it's already designed, right? It's already in production.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:15.000
You don't ever do anything, just download the cursor, give a prompt, it will start generating.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:19.000
I mean… Okay.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:25.000
And then in the later stage, uh, once you will exhaust your entire, like, quota, a free quota, then they will ask you for the payment.

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:34.000
Uh, but yeah. So here, if you will go and check, uh, sorry, so here, if you will go and check, so they are giving you an option to even add your own models.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:39.000
So, on-model means API key. That is the meaning of the model.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:40.000
Yep.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:46.000
Okay, so is there any, like, cloud-based, uh, this cursor? Where we can, like, for one hour or one day, we can use.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:54.000
No, there is no cloud-based cursor. Even Windows Surf is not a cloud-based. Firebase is a cloud-based. So, I have shown you the Firebase, right? Firebase Studio.

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:58.000
So Firebase Studio is basically a cloud base, but not cursor, not WindServe.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:10:59.000
Okay, yeah, thank you, sir.

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:09.000
Yeah. Can we use Euripake in a cursor? Yes, you can use it. So, the cursor is giving you an option for, like, uh, you know, external API calling, so that is, uh, pretty much feasible.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:14.000
Okay, next one is Ram Ramesh Kumar, yes, please go ahead.

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:19.000
Yeah, go ahead, go ahead, guys. Ask your question. Jubair, please go ahead with your question.

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
Uh, Jeremy, are you… am I audible? I think you have a chance to the talk. This is my first time.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:28.000
Yes, uh, yeah, Juver, you're audible, yes. Yeah. Okay, okay. You were not able to join us today?

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:35.000
Yeah, I did a study about this, uh, talk to you the first time.

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:36.000
That is where you get… get a chance to talk to you.

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:39.000
Okay, okay, fine, got it, yeah. Uh, again?

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:43.000
Um, I'm fresh up there about the generative AI. My question is.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:44.000
Mhm. Mm-hmm.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:49.000
Uh, if I learn the generative AI, so what about the job.

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:58.000
If not a job, can I make, like, any kind of application, or… is the better for me. I have a PBS experience of the Java.

02:11:58.000 --> 02:11:59.000
That would be suggestion about it.

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:11.000
Mm-hmm. Okay, okay. So, see, uh, job-wise, if I'll say, so there are enough jobs, right? I'll never say that, and job is increasing. Yes, there was some adjustment.

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:18.000
Which industry is going on, and uh… You must have seen in our news that people are doing this hiring and firing, all those games.

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:23.000
And again, this is nothing new. Sometimes, so people used to, like, hype it more and more.

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:28.000
But if you will look into the positive side, a real positive side, I will say.

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:40.000
That people… have started hiring, and believe me, next 6 months or in a year of time. So, once this entire resuffle will be done, because again, that reshuffling is important.

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:56.000
Uh, because if a company is having so many people, and if they're not productive, if they're not able to work, if they're not able to adopt a new culture, what company will do? Obviously, company has to take the action at some point over time. And this is the action, like a series of things which the company is trying to take.

02:12:56.000 --> 02:13:10.000
Uh, second expect is that, that yes, everyone is trying to build their own strong AI portfolio, maybe in a product, maybe for a client. And because of that, everyone is hiring. This hiring is going on since the last 4-5 year.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:19.000
Yes, uh, it's a different story that generative AI exists just two, two and a half years back, so it has started, but yeah, AI was there. We were using machine learning, deep learning, all those things.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:27.000
So, hiring will increase even more in this era, Gen AI era, and you can just observe the market, it's increasing now.

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:36.000
So that's the first part, job is there. Second part, as you have asked, that can you build something? So, yeah, as you have mentioned, that you are coming from Java background, and you have some tech background.

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:44.000
You can build it, but for that, you need a problem statement, so if you have any kind of problem statement, start building it, because now.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:48.000
Uh, building at least, I would say, MVP. I'm not saying that full-scale things.

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:54.000
But building MVP is way more easier than before. Only MVP.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:14:03.000
Minimum viable product only, right? Not like a complete full-scale system, which can take a load of anything, and where you can integrate, like, a thousand people.

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:11.000
For that, you need a real, real developer. Still, it's required. So hope I'm able to answer your question, Jubair.

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
Yeah, yeah, this, uh, pretty much, pretty much I get it.

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:14.000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:26.000
Thank you. Yeah, that's my concern. At least if I don't, like, hit the job or something else, at least make something, and, like, make some freelancing or… or at least one satisfaction. That's what I want after this call.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:38.000
Exactly. I suggest everyone, right? Not from today. Today's age of AI, but I'm teaching since the last 8 years, I believe. So, since 8th year, I simply say to everyone.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:44.000
That you are not in college, you are not preparing for the exam, you are not supposed to go and, like, get some sort of a marks.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:52.000
You are going to appear for a real interview. So, when there was no AI, uh, no age of AI, I would say.

02:14:52.000 --> 02:15:04.000
Even at that point over time, I kept on saying, people, that, uh… build something, right? Because you will be able to create a more value, you will be more valuable in a market as compared to anyone else in a market.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:09.000
So, it was a fact. 10 years back, and it is a fact.

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:17.000
Right? So, if you are building. Believe me, your level of experience, the kind of a value that you will be able to.

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:27.000
Get in a market when you showcase your product will be on a different label, and yes, if you are able to build something, uh, which is going to push you as an entrepreneur.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:33.000
Right? Where you are able to generate a revenue, nothing can be better than that, believe me. Nothing.

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:34.000
All right.

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:47.000
That will give you the ultimate level of satisfaction, right? But… to reach out to that label, at least you have to work on a disciplined banner. I'm not saying that, like, 18 hour a day, or 20 hour a day, no. Disciplined manner, maybe just 1 hour, 2 hour, but.

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:59.000
For a very long time. That will yield the result. Long-term investment, right? We all talk about the long-term investment in our finance. So… This is… this works exactly in the same manner.

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:00.000
Discipline, consistency. And long-term.

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:12.000
All right. Yeah, I'm gonna appreciate it. I see you're very, very, like, what is it, hard worker, or whatever you can do, like, complete four hours. This is the unbelievable thing.

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:17.000
14 hours is not, like, I used to give a lecture for 14 hours a day.

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:18.000
So, 404 is… 4 is nothing. I can continuously speak for, like, next, like, 11, 12 hours without stopping.

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:23.000
Wow, I can't believe it. How can you do it?

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:24.000
I'm not…

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:29.000
Yeah, that's one thing also making me motivated. I can do at least 2-4 hours, one seat.

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:39.000
Everyone can do, everyone can do, believe me, everyone can do. It looks painful on day one, day two, right? See, I always keep on saying that, there is a… 0 to 1 journey, and 0 to 1 journey.

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:49.000
Is going to be tough, right? For everyone, 0 to 1 gen. It doesn't matter what you do, what you're going to start, or what you're trying to learn. 1 to 10 journey will be smooth.

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:57.000
And 10 and above, you'll flourish. So… But yes, you have to, like, 10 and above. To go to 10 and above.

02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:02.000
You have to start from 0 to 1.

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:03.000
Yeah, yeah, thanks. Yes, Lamis, please go ahead.

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:13.000
Very true, aren't you? Uh, Sudan, so I have some couple of doubts from the cursor, right? You have, uh… given the multiple option, cursor, wind surp, or something.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:16.000
So, can I use in my office environment? Is there any restriction?

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:39.000
Yeah, I think, I think nowadays, almost everyone is… even my wife is working, right? She, like, uh… Uh, she's a proper coder and, like, a developer. Uh, so basically, like, uh, their company has allowed, and I have spoken to many of my friends in recent days, who is working with some of the companies, and nowadays, everyone is allowed to, like, install and, like, do their job.

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:40.000
So, yes, it is. That depends upon your company. That, that I can't tell you.

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:46.000
Okay. Okay, no, no, do we need to ask any special permission before using the… tools are done. Every difference.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:52.000
That you will have to, like, ask and talk to your, maybe, admin, who used to, like, manage the installation and everything. So that I can't say, because…

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:57.000
I even… yeah, even if per Europhone, nah, Euro chat as well, can I use, uh, in my operations?

02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:04.000
No, for Yuri, it's a web portal, right? It's a web-based, basically. So Yuri's web-based.

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:05.000
Now, so you can use Yuri anywhere. You don't need any installation, right, for Yuri.

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:09.000
If you have a bit, can I use?

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:18.000
Okay, okay. Then, next thing for that, right, which you have three tools, right? Which one can we go get with that? Because instead of avoiding the multiple things.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:19.000
The prior waste today. Cursor, right? Yeah.

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:25.000
No, I'll simply… yeah, simple, I'll suggest, go with Karsal. Yes, for now. For now, go with cursor. Simple.

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:26.000
Yeah.

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:32.000
Right? Because I know there are, like, so many tools, so many distractions, everything, right? Uh, just with cursor, simple.

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:33.000
As of now.

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:40.000
Yeah, with Harser also, it has given multiple models, right? It's everything connecting web model or URI API? Can we connect to the URI system?

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:56.000
You can connect with the UI API as well, so they give you, like, over here, uh, basically, like, you can try to pass your own API key, and then they're giving you one option to, like, uh, you know, connect with your OpenAI API, and they're giving you another option, so where you will be able to connect your own, any custom API.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:19:01.000
Right? And then you can, like, try to attach it. So, in both the way it works, actually.

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:02.000
Yeah, yeah.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:10.000
But it will work best, I would say, right? So, you can override the OpenAI endpoint. So, let's suppose this is the endpoint that I have.

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:19.000
I can do what? So I can try to give my own endpoint for a chat completion, a URE endpoint, basically. See, at the end of the day, this requires only an endpoint, and here, if you will come.

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:27.000
Let me show it to you. So, in a uron, if you are going to come, so we have exposed already URI API.

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:33.000
And then we have our endpoint, and here is our chat completion endpoint, which we have given to you. So you can try to use this endpoint.

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
Looks like you're not.

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:36.000
Oh, is it? Okay, okay, sorry. Okay. Okay, now I'm sharing, right?

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
100%. Yeah, they're not sharing. They're not able to… Yeah, it's loading, you know, we are able to see.

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:42.000
Yes. Now it is… now it is happening.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:49.000
Yeah. Okay, so basically, like, there is a… in a cursor, when you will come, so let me close all of these things.

02:19:49.000 --> 02:20:05.000
So let's suppose you are here, and if you will come over here, so you will be able to find out that it is giving you option to add a model. Add model means, let's suppose I can host a model in my local, like, in my local, proper local, no cloud.

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:06.000
Mm-hmm.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:14.000
Right? And then I can try to give an access to this one, or let's suppose I have a Yuri API, so I can do one thing, so I can try to even give a endpoint.

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:19.000
Over here, with the Yuri API. So, if localhost, then localhost. Otherwise.

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:34.000
Yuri API endpoint, I can copy from here. And then I can try to… Sorry, where is my cursor? So, entropic key, override the base URL, yeah.

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:43.000
So I can even give this kind of a, like, a chat completion API over here, API access, or a streaming API access, and it will be able to use it.

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:59.000
So, all these options, they have already, like, made it open for all of us, so I can try to give an API. At the end of the day, it requires AI access. That's it. Cursor is a tool. Cursor is an interface, it requires AI access. If you are able to give it, it will work.

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:12.000
Otherwise, just go with the paid version of Cursor. So, it is, it is giving you a free tier. I think it is giving you enough number of free tier for testing and building at least a small application. But beyond that, obviously, we'll be looking for, like, your, uh.

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:15.000
Paid access.

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:18.000
Where is the cursor setting option? Which one did you click for the cursor setting?

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:23.000
So basically, close. Close this one, now follow along with my, uh, mouse.

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:26.000
So, here… this option, right?

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
Mm-hmm. Yes, yeah.

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:39.000
By default, you will be able to see auto, by default, when you will install, right? Let's suppose I'm clicking on auto, I'm trying to switch off this auto. Switch off this auto, now add model option.

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:40.000
Okay, got it, got it. But auto means which model is selecting? It's a pre-model, or…?

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:44.000
Got it?

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:45.000
When we select with auto.

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:55.000
No, so by default, if you're going at with the auto, right, so majority of times it is going to select a cloud day, uh, but let's suppose if I'm switching off auto, so I can try to select only GPT-4.0.

02:21:55.000 --> 02:22:03.000
So now it will be, like, using this GPT-4.0. Let's suppose if I have added some of my custom model. For example, I have added this test, right? Test is my, basically. It's not a default one.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:12.000
You will not be able to see it in your cursor. So, test is basically a MyModel, which I have attached from my side, yeah? Custom model, basically. So I can select this one, so now it will use a test model.

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:13.000
Or if I'm going to keep it on auto, then it will be, like, in auto stage.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:23.000
Yeah, yeah, sure. Yeah, but while I was trying with Cloudy at all, it's not working on my machine. The paint model, right?

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:24.000
Cloud is not a free model. Cloud is the most expensive model, actually.

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:27.000
Claudi Sonata.

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:28.000
Cloud Air Force on it, right? It's not a, like, a free one, just keep it auto as of now.

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:33.000
Yeah. Okay, fine. And my next question is that, right, we have built the API system.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:37.000
Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm.

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:47.000
Uh, how are we integrating with the server and generate… no, attach the GitHub and upload into the server.

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:48.000
Apply… sorry?

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:55.000
Deployment… deploy into the server. The… which one you, but… No, no, actually, which one you built to the API, right? How can we integrate with the server?

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:56.000
Real-time server.

02:22:56.000 --> 02:23:11.000
Okay, well, so already API endpoint we have given to you, a code example we have given to you. Now, so let's suppose if you have to use this OpenAI model, or any model, right? Any model, basically, right? Any model with any framework. So, in the next class.

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:28.000
As per your syllabus, I'm going to teach you that how you will be able to use an API if I have to show you an example now, so maybe I can copy just this piece of a code, where you can try to write your prompt, and then I'll come to this one.

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:29.000
Yeah. You know…

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:36.000
Uh, let me, let me show you a quick demo. A very, very quick demo. So this is my API endpoint, right? This is my API endpoint. Now, here I have to pass my key, so what I will do, I'll just try to go here, API key.

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:50.000
And I'll try to click on Create API key, give any name, it will be able to create my API key. This is my code, just for a chat completion. We have an API endpoint for email. I'll show you image generation as well, just wait, now itself.

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:56.000
So I have just replaced with my URI API, as you can see, right? Those static, static, I have replaced my URI API key, and this is my prompt.

02:23:56.000 --> 02:24:10.000
Write a poem about the artificial intelligence. And this is the model ID. So, we have given you 25 model access, so you can just change this ID, and you have to basically, like, do a prompt, whatever you are looking for.

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:16.000
And execute, now see. See the magic? So it is… so now I'm able to get the result, right?

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:17.000
Yes.

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:40.000
So, it is able to basically write a poem for me. Let's suppose if I would like to generate an image, right? If I have to generate the image, by the way. So, AI frame… not AI framework, code exam… AI-available model endpoints, yeah. So, let's suppose if I would like to generate the image. So, here is, again, the endpoint that we have given to you. So, this is the curl endpoint.

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:45.000
Uh, curl command we have given to you, I can quickly convert that into a Python-based.

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:50.000
Let me convert it. Python code. For this, yeah?

02:24:50.000 --> 02:25:02.000
So again, same. See, only 2-3 things are required. One is this endpoint, this URL. So this URL is nothing but… a URL which is allowing you to reach out to my system, a Euron system.

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:03.000
Okay.

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:13.000
Because we are hosting our entire server somewhere, right? So, for any… even you are using an API from, like, a… ChatGPT or OpenAI or Google, or anywhere in this entire world, doesn't matter whether you're using this API or.

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:32.000
Someone else API. So, there will be an endpoint. Ender point means it will help you out to reach out to that system. Now, inside that system, what you are trying to access, so let's suppose inside that system, this model is running. So, I would like to access this model, right? With this input, right? And then, token is nothing but authorization.

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:33.000
Great. Mm-hmm. Yeah.

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:44.000
So, like a password. So, don't worry, I know many people don't understand the fundamentals of API, so that's a reason there will be a proper class on that, where we will create our own API.

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:52.000
By using, like, a small, small, like, code pieces, and after that, I'm going to show you how to use the API.

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:53.000
Yep.

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:58.000
Now, just I wonder, you have built the system, but we didn't apply anything into the server, that's why you want to crowd-check it.

02:25:58.000 --> 02:25:59.000
So, IPL booking system.

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:09.000
Uh, yeah. So… Yeah, so let's suppose, like, image generation, right? So I have to basically generate the image. I will, like, use the same Yuri.

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:29.000
Token that I have already created, right, replaces my API token, and a beautiful sunset over the mountain. Let me ask one thing, uh, give me a… image of… Newton holding… wine in hand.

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:38.000
Okay.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:39.000
Northern. Yeah.

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:45.000
It will generate the image for me, yeah? So it's executing, and it will be able to generate the image for me. So I'll teach you this one. I know, like, this complete things, and many of us, many of us technically don't even know that… what is API, how… we will be able to create it.

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:54.000
For… here we have created the API, right? Api endpoint. But how this will be created? When I say that this is my API endpoint, now you have written some XYZ function. How you can do it?

02:26:54.000 --> 02:27:02.000
Yeah? How you can attach the authorization for that API, so that without password, no one will be able to log in into, or no one will be able to hit your system.

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:12.000
So all of these things I'm going to cover, I'm going to teach, because without this, you will never be able to build even as smallest of the product, which works in real time.

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:16.000
One more question. As part of the syllabus, do we cover the deployment activities?

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:17.000
There's a lot, a lot. A lot.

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:25.000
They'll let them up something. Okay. Well, yeah.

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:26.000
Just wait, I'll call out the name. Yeah, Sai, please go ahead.

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:27.000
Sir, I have a question.

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:31.000
Hi, sir, this is Bharatus.

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:32.000
Mm-hmm.

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:38.000
Uh, sir, I have a couple of questions. Sir, first question is, when you have created that IPL, uh, uh, IPL thingy.

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:39.000
Mm-hmm.

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:49.000
So is that, like, how is it able to figure out that, okay, these are the teams, this is the stadiums in which it is… games are happening, all that is because of the pre-training of that model?

02:27:49.000 --> 02:28:07.000
No, no, no, it's not because of the pre-train of the model. I have given the proper context, first of all, so that's the reason I have generated the context, and then… Basically, it will be able to understand, it will try to break it down all of those contexts which I have given to a cursor in a small, small, small, small model. This is where this agent comes into picture.

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:16.000
Right? Just like a human being, so agent is nothing but whatever prompt which I have given in a beginning. Uh, so basically, this prompt, right? This entire long prompt which I have given.

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:21.000
So, it will be able to break it down line by line, line by line, and then it will start working on it.

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:22.000
This is, like, rag, isn't it? This is like reg… like, where you are, like.

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:32.000
This is how… Sorry, it is? No, it's not RAG, actually. Rag is different. Conceptually, RAG is different. This is just a context I'm giving to an agent.

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:33.000
That's it. Mm-hmm.

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:44.000
Okay, okay, okay. Uh, so that is one question. Second question, sir, Yuri… Is it, uh, like, you already use an API as the name suggests, but how is it different from an AI agent?

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:45.000
Uh, like, conflict.

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:56.000
So, Yuri, is he agent? Agent is something which will be able to do an end-to-end task. And basically, agent requires an access of those APIs, those models.

02:28:56.000 --> 02:29:09.000
So, URI is not an agent. Uri is basically a middleware, so which is going to help you out, to give you an access. For example, I've generated this image, right? So, just by calling what? Image API, I was… my Newton, I think.

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:23.000
Image, like, spelling was, uh, different, so that's the reason. In EWTN. So, with the help of this API, right, and endpoint, I'm able to generate these images, I'm able to write a.

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:38.000
Basically a poem over here, in the circuit over with a Luminous grace, all those things. And again, I'm able to see, generate the image, right? Image of Newton, a beautiful one, ISD quality one, immediately. So, basically, this is giving you an access. Yuri is giving you an access to all of those models.

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:52.000
Which is by default required for these agents. We are talking about agents over here, right? So I'll explain to you what is actually agent is, because we are going to create a lot of agent on my own. Every one of us, we are going to create the agent, not just one or two.

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:58.000
Throughout the entire session, more than hundreds of agents we are going to create, but agent is nothing but a program.

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:03.000
Right? A piece of the code. Let's try to think in this way. A piece of the code which is going to.

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:33.000
Big, uh, access of an AI, and… whatever you have written for the agent, that, okay, fine, so you are the agent, which will try to break down the entire input into a multiple-part, into a multiple context, and then you will do the research. So, agent will do that. If you're going to ask an agent that, okay, book a schedule. Whenever someone is going to enter some time.

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:35.000
Okay.

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:40.000
So book a meeting for me. So, agent will book a meeting automatically. So, agent is nothing but a piece of a code which will be able to do a task. The way function was doing it before, or automation was doing it before. At the end of the day, agent requires a LLM access, because LLM is only going to give a capability.

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:46.000
To the entire knowledge base, plus. Understand anything in a natural language.

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:51.000
Because you as a human are going to give an input as an original language. I've given my entire input as a natural language, right?

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:52.000
Yes. Yes, yes.

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:58.000
This one. So this is where… just wait for some time, I think it's too early. Many of us are confused between the agents.

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:02.000
Uh, going forward, you will be able to create such kind of agent on your own, very soon.

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:18.000
Got it, sir. And last question, sir. Like, in… previously, in the last few years, we have learned about Transformers, uh… encoder-decoder systems and all. But do you think things are all that learning will become obsolete because we are… to use it directly.

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:34.000
No, not at all. Not at all. Never. Never, I would say. And those learnings are still relevant, it will be relevant even after a 10, 20 year, or maybe a 100 year, right? Because we are able to speak as we learn a lot and as we.

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:46.000
Like, grow older and older, so obviously, uh, we get a maturity, and we will be able to phrase a lot more good sentences, humorous one, I would say, but still.

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:47.000
Got it. Right.

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:55.000
The base is ABCD. It will be there. It will be there, literally, it will be there to understand our mathematics, obviously, you have to know the counting from 0 to 9, right? 0 to 9 numbers. That's a base.

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
Yes. Yes.

02:31:57.000 --> 02:32:13.000
So, it's not going anywhere. Literally, it's not going anywhere. Even in a physics, right, we are, like, I have given an example yesterday, that we are able to build a, like, a SIP, we are able to build a big, big infrastructure, a plane kind of a things, and even, like, international space kind of things, but basic physics.

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:17.000
A projectile, uh, escape velocity, all those things are still required.

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:18.000
Yes. Yes.

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:23.000
Right? So, it will be relevant all the time. Uh, yeah, Milan, go ahead.

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:32.000
Actually, sir, I have one question. Uh, sort of like, uh, if we launch this generative AI about it, and, like, what type of job opportunity will be open in industry?

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:33.000
As a taster.

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:42.000
Let's say Java opportunities, Java opportunities are always available, it's even available now, my student is getting placed for my previous batches, from my current batches. So, opportunity will be there.

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:45.000
It just depends upon you how capable you are.

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:53.000
Uh, and actually, as I am currently learning about the AI, uh, about the tester, testing.

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:54.000
Don't… don't learn. Testing is not having any future and opportunity.

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:58.000
Domain. So, like, what will be?

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:03.000
Yeah. Yeah, Veraj, please go ahead.

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:04.000
No, that's fine, yeah.

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:11.000
Hi, sir, this is Baro Twitch. Sorry, I've been, like, uh… Yeah, it's been, like, a couple of years back when you were teaching in Iran, in Neuron, like, I joined the bat, but then I was unable to complete after the Python due to the obvious things.

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
Okay. Okay.

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:16.000
So, from there, I know you. So, you know, your teaching and just wanted to, like… the reason immediately when I saw your launched it, without any illustration, I just joined the batch.

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:21.000
Thank you.

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:22.000
Thank you, thank you. Mm-hmm.

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:30.000
So, uh, yeah, so, like, my daughter, like, since we are into Jennai and all, like, how relevant is about to have the background of ML concepts and, uh.

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:31.000
Is it something like… hmm…

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:44.000
It will not create a hurdle for you, I would say, right? But, like I have mentioned, that, uh, in an industry, many things will keep on coming. It's not going to stop now, and not even maybe after, like, a couple of years. It is going to stop.

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:51.000
And if you don't want to take a burden off those new things which is coming into our market.

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:57.000
Now, to eliminate those things, or those, like, uh, I would say, events in the future.

02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:05.000
I always suggest that build our fundamentals. But, yeah, if you would like to join our industry, just a general industry.

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:15.000
I think this is more than enough for now. But, if you have to remove a bottleneck for the future, then take your time, spend some time with those basic fundamentals.

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:18.000
And then, like, uh… move ahead.

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:24.000
Okay. So, and what will be the, like, role of job, like, GenA developer, sir? Is it, like, do we need to know the UI and the backend things?

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:45.000
So, it's not… it's not the developer, I would say, so people are hiring on a lead position, on a manager position, on a director position, so it's the same… A lineage we used to follow, that we are following in any other domain, any other technology. So, lineage-wise, it's not like a gen AI developer. Yes, there is a developer, there is a lead, there is a manager, there is a architect, there is a director.

02:34:45.000 --> 02:35:03.000
No? So, everyone, the way we were doing a task, now we are doing it with the help of this generative AI framework. We are trying to solve the problem with the help of generative AI problem. That's it. That's the only thing which has changed with the new technology layer. Apart from that, nothing has changed.

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:04.000
It's a generative AI lead, generative AI engineer, generative AI manager, generative AI architect, generative AI director.

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:08.000
Okay, so, like, what, uh, the role will be called, sir? Is it, like, uh… I mean…

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:12.000
Okay, so, like, if you're migrating to, like, I mean, currently I'm working in the Kubernetes part, so if I wanted to migrate, like, uh, to the data science domain, like.

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:19.000
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:20.000
Mm-hmm.

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:25.000
Using these DNA, I think, whatever learning. So, like. Like, do you need to know the background of UI and backend background… I mean, back-end development things.

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:39.000
Back-end development, I think you should know a little bit, because back-end will be required. Eui will not be required, because now, if you give a Figma or… like, uh, an administrator feed, so it will be able to generate, most of the time in a very, very.

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:45.000
Accurate way, which will be dynamic towards all the screens. So, back-end, but back-end is main.

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:48.000
Okay, so, like, once this course is completed, like, we'll be able to, like, reach… And what about the system design concepts? Like, do we need…

02:35:48.000 --> 02:36:03.000
Obviously, yes, yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, that will be required if you are going to apply for a product-based companies. Then, system design and DSA both will come together, doesn't matter for which role you are going to apply, whether that's Gen AI or even a front-end developer role.

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000
Okay.

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:14.000
But yeah, they have, like, a filtration criteria. But nowadays, even, like, uh, they are changing their approach. I have seen a couple of companies, not all have changed the approach, uh, still.

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:19.000
Most of the company has the same approach. But yeah, nowadays, they're allowing you to, you know, use a vibe coding.

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:22.000
Uh, and they will be looking for the explanation from your side.

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
Okay, sure. Yeah. Uh… Yeah, fingers.

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:28.000
Yep. Yeah, thanks. Madhav, please go ahead. Yeah, good morning.

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:40.000
Hello, sir, good morning. Uh, directly, I have two questions. First question is, I am using i3… laptop with the SSD RAM and, uh, with 8GB RAM and SSD hardcore.

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:41.000
Mm-hmm.

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:47.000
So, I want to know, do I need a, uh, this, um… But as well, graphics card installed my laptop, or do I need to update my laptop?

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:54.000
First of all, I think in i3, you will not be able to integrate it. The configuration that you said, so graphics, you will not be able to add it.

02:36:54.000 --> 02:37:02.000
Uh, second of all, it's not required. We have a cloud platform, and as long as you can use that same laptop, use it. Once.

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
It will not support you, or it will give you a problem.

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:08.000
Then, obviously, you'll have to, like, upgrade yourself. Simple. As of now.

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:11.000
I have a piece of… sufficient? If I buy the graphics card?

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:22.000
As of now, as of now, don't go for a buy. Alison, if you are able to use it comfortably, that laptop, the same one, uh, right. Use it, don't invest anywhere. Uh, once it will not work, it will, like, stop.

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:26.000
Uh, working or executing your code, then move ahead. Yeah? But not now, not immediately.

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:32.000
Okay, okay, so second question, uh, can we have some kind of a dedicated class or a session.

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:37.000
In which you can guide us about the new business opportunities coming in January.

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:38.000
Like, I'm pretty sure…

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:46.000
Not as a part of this class. So, I do take a lot of sessions on entrepreneurship, right? I do take a lot of sessions on our product building.

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:50.000
But, uh, this is not a part of your class lecture, so I'll not say yes to this one.

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:54.000
Uh, because if I'll say yes, then I have to fulfill it.

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:57.000
No, no, I am not saying in this class, sir. If we, uh, YouTube, so many, so many experts are saying.

02:37:57.000 --> 02:38:00.000
You will… yeah, you will get to know. You will… You will get to know.

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:06.000
Agent DK is coming, agent…

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:13.000
Uh, you will get to know, but yeah, I don't believe in those kind of a GAN in general, because there are so many people out there who used to give it.

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:21.000
Uh, if I used to come with those things, then I'll come with the practical stuff. That, okay, this is something which is going to happen, and I show it.

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000
Thank you so much.

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:30.000
Yep, okay, so… just build, build, believe me. The only way, or the only escape route is to build, nothing else.

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:36.000
Okay, next is Puskar. Please go ahead. Yeah, Pushkar sendeh, please.

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:37.000
Yeah, you're on mute.

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:42.000
Oh, hello, sir. Yes, sir? Or, uh… Yes. So, for general interviews, like, DLC.

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:47.000
And transformer architecture that are required. Like, go back proportion in the deli.

02:38:47.000 --> 02:39:04.000
In general, in general, uh, there is a chance. There is a chance, if they have mentioned that into a JD, right, there is a chance that they are going to ask about it, and if you have Euron Plus access, I have already explained everything. Starting from a theory and practical, everything.

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:11.000
So it's better to have it. If you don't have it, so it's not monetary. But yeah, there is a chance, company to company.

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:18.000
Okay, so, in the role of Jane AI as architects, what is your JAI role, is there any use of DL consideration?

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:19.000
Actually, if you'll see all of this model, right? The transformer, the model that we are going to fine-tune.

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:24.000
Regarding the RNN birds, uh…

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:32.000
Uh, the base is basically a neural network, which is coming from the starting of deep learning.

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:39.000
And then the core fundamentals of these models are coming from a transformer, which is a part of your research paper called as Attention is All You Need.

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:46.000
Where you have an encoder-decoder layers, and eventually that is a part of your NLP.

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:51.000
Okay, no, no, my question is just, like, a DL concept regarding the RNN are required in the job, miss.

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:59.000
Development like that in this, to train model new model.

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:00.000
Okay.

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:09.000
That I can't… that I can't say. It depends company to company, interview to interview. If someone is taking an interview just on a framework, just on a… because they will mention it, they will mention it. So that's the reason it's good to have the entire fundamentals revised, at least.

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:14.000
Okay, sorry, is it good that, uh, Miss, uh. I completely owe this, Shannon, Mission.

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:17.000
Focusing on only RNN concept, like. Nlp.

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:25.000
That's fine. Cnn basically works with respect to our vision, so that's completely fine.

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:26.000
But good to have, right? If you're looking for, like, a broader picture, then good to have.

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:29.000
Okay. That's it, sir.

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:33.000
Okay, next one is Asis, go ahead. Yeah, go ahead.

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:43.000
That's what I'm saying. Yes, sir, uh, you just delayed on that online testing, but as a tester, I'm having 6 years of experience into this industry.

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:44.000
Mm-hmm.

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:50.000
So, like, if I'm learning this NAI, so within how many days, we will have to, you know, set up.

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:55.000
Like, you know, mindset within these days, we're able to do completely transition.

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:56.000
Max to max, max to max 6 months, not more than that.

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:59.000
It's very good to know that it…

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:00.000
Atom access. Sixth month is more than enough.

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:07.000
Complete taxes. Like, you know, within 6 months that we will have.

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:10.000
Self-confidence, like, you know, we can do work in this GenA field, uh.

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:25.000
You will be… you will be having confidence or not, that's a different story, that's a different question, because that depends upon your effort that you are going to put up.

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:26.000
Huh.

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:33.000
I can't say that, okay, fine, so just by watching my lectures, or anyone else's lecture, you will be having, uh, that confidence, right? So that depends upon your work. But yes, if anyone is putting up a genuine effort in a regular mode.

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:39.000
Then, in 6 months, it is practically possible, not overnight, but yes, in 6 months.

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:45.000
If someone is not putting up a genuine effort consistently. Then even 6 years is less.

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:52.000
Okay, so, like, you know. Definitely, sir, you are with us each and every, like, thing, so you'll reach out to him for that.

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:58.000
But, uh, sir, again, also, this question is Sam for who are doing automation testing in testing, not in Manuel.

02:41:58.000 --> 02:41:59.000
In automation testing also, this thing is going to happen for them.

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:06.000
Mm-hmm. Sorry, can you please repeat once again?

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:09.000
So, sir, for those who are doing, like, automation testing and testing fail.

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:10.000
They have to also, like, you know, whatever you suggested me, they have…

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:25.000
Mm-hmm. This thing is gone. Testing, automation, testing or manual tester was gone 5 years back, I believe. Yes, there are some companies who is hiring, I know. Right, but still, it's gone, and automation testing is also, like, on a verge of.

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:46.000
Uh, we can say extension. So, it will be gone. Like, see, as of now, people are looking for someone who can build the entire system end-to-end, test the entire system end-to-end, write all the edge cases with the help of AI, right? And, uh, in an industry, I've seen that kind of people, and yes, that kind of people does exist now.

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:50.000
Uh, the testing is not a job.

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:52.000
Okay, sir. Thank you for, uh, like, for your suggestion, sir. We will reach out to each and everything.

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:56.000
Yeah, yeah.

02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000
We'll try to do a complete within 6 months. That I was trying to do.

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:08.000
Yep, yep, yep, yep. Sadiq is saying you are trolling at us. See, I'm talking about the reality. Uh, maybe many of you will not agree with me.

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:14.000
Uh, for now, but wait for one year. You all will agree. So… Yeah, Venkates, please go ahead.

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:24.000
So, I have a question, Sudanshu. Yeah, uh, I recently come across one term, uh, it says as AI.

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:25.000
Mm-hmm.

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:31.000
Journalists, uh, DNA journalists, I don't understand. I just attended their demo session, and I understand, like.

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:34.000
No coding required, just with the VIP coding tools and no code tools.

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:36.000
Again, not true, not true. Like, I told her… yeah, I have given the reason, right? So, not exactly true.

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:44.000
You can… what exactly is that?

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:51.000
What is that? So, next… they claim that, you know, in the next decade would be with only the AI journalists.

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:55.000
And what exactly is that when I try to ask them, they dodged.

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:56.000
But…

02:43:56.000 --> 02:44:07.000
The AI journalist, in terms of you are talking about the digital medium, a print, basically, or you are talking about someone who delivers the news. So which mode you're talking about?

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:08.000
Uh.

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:17.000
See, there are multiple ways to consume the news, right? So, we read out the, like, headlines on our mobile devices or any other devices. That is one way of consuming a news. The other way of consuming a news is.

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:20.000
That someone is delivering it. So which way we are talking about?

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:24.000
Yeah, the Mustafa just mentioned that it's a journalist, not journalist, like, news anchor.

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:41.000
Also, again, generalism, okay, so generalism, like, if I'll talk about a print, so maybe even now, most of the, like, lines or rephrases has been written by AI, but yeah, there is a human journalist who is giving a feed, who is giving an input, because they are capturing ground report, right? And without ground report, what AI will do?

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:47.000
How I will be able to get the feed. Uh, if I'll talk about maybe a real human delivering a news.

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:53.000
Uh, so, yes, people have tried lots of AI anchors, and I'm talking about.

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:54.000
Sorry, sorry to disturb you, sir. Not journalism. Generalist, AI generalist.

02:44:54.000 --> 02:45:01.000
Yeah. Okay, generalist means? Okay, G-E-N-E, right?

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:07.000
Yes, sir, exactly. Yeah.

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:08.000
Yeah.

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:19.000
Okay, fine, got it. So, I was talking about news anchor. Journalists, right? Ai journalist. See, people have given a name called as Vive Coding, then this AI journalist, then… some, like, new term you will be able to get tomorrow. Don't fall after those terms.

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:27.000
Right, so, it's fine. What is the meaning of AI journalist? Means, anyone can, like, one single human will be able to do everything.

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:37.000
How it is possible? Right? Let's suppose I have a capability of AI, but let's suppose I'm not a domain expert. Let's suppose I'm walking into logistics, I'm walking into a supply chain, maybe I'm walking into finance, right?

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:45.000
I have to understand my customer, I have to understand my ecosystem, I have to understand the problem which I'm solving, I have to understand my existing system.

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:52.000
Right. How I can generalize each and everything. So, uh, yes, influencers will be technically, uh, generalist.

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:54.000
Gm, journalist, right? But, uh… impractical, I don't think so.

02:45:54.000 --> 02:46:00.000
Yeah.

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:01.000
You can be expert in physics chemistry and mathematics all the time, right?

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:06.000
Okay, so…

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:07.000
Right?

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:19.000
An Arian historian. Yeah, so same goes with AI. There is nothing called as, like, a journalist. Yeah, there will be some people who will give, like, some thoughts that, okay, this is how you can become, but yeah, I don't think, like, uh…

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:20.000
Yeah. That is 3 lakh rupees for that course for 6 months, sir.

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:24.000
It's going anywhere closer to reality. And nowadays, like, uh… Okay, why? And what they were teaching.

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:27.000
With 6 months. Yeah.

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:30.000
How do you use ChatGPT? How to do a prompting?

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:33.000
Yeah, all the white coding tools and element else.

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:45.000
I mean, and you have paid 3 lakh rupees. Okay, come to my class, I'll teach you in two classes, and you will be able to do a better vibe coding than someone has taught you in somewhere else.

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:56.000
3 lakh, it's too much, man, like, give me that money, like, I'll give you a lot of access, like, unlimited access of, like, everything. And I will be available personally for you, 24 by 7.

02:46:56.000 --> 02:47:00.000
Even in my sleep, you can call me. With that… with that kind of money.

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:02.000
Right? So they're growing good vibos, vicinity. That guy.

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:09.000
No, I'm… I'm… I'm… I'm literally saying yes, I'm literally serious about those 3 lakh rupees.

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:10.000
Yeah, outskill. Yes, sir.

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:15.000
I would… I would… I would love to charge. I'm like, T, like.

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:18.000
Don't do it, don't do it, please, don't do it. Yeah, there are people… I know, there are people who is trying to fool, who is trying to create a FOMO.

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:23.000
No, I said, we were saying.

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:42.000
Out of you, and uh… they are, like, charging 2, like, 3 lakh, and ultimately, what they are teaching… I mean, like, prompting, okay? I mean, like, who teaches a prompting? It's a domain that we learn, it's a… Like, a product that we learn. And vibe coating… see, I have taught you vibe coding today, right? And today itself, we are able to create a beautiful website.

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:43.000
Great.

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:49.000
A working one. This is how easy it was.

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:59.000
I don't… like, see, we are living into that problem with the market, is that we are living into influencer market. Uh, there are genuine people who never exaggerate our things.

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:04.000
But the problem with those people are, you will never see those people on those platforms, because they will never go viral.

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:09.000
They will never go viral, believe me, right? People are not going to give a like, thumbs up, or share to them.

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:14.000
And there are people who will try to create unnecessary hype, who will try to, you know, discover a new terms.

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:22.000
When they don't even know, like, what is the actual meaning of those terms, but yeah, they are just trying to go out and exhilarating, and they have a big distribution.

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:28.000
And, uh, there will be, again, like, millions of people who will follow them, who will like them, and who will eventually pay them.

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:34.000
And then they will realize. So basically, you are paying 3 lakh to realize.

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:52.000
That you should not do it. Just to realize. Yeah, why don't you start a college student easily pay 8 lakh for just the… See, that is, again, justified. See, degree is something which is a culture, right? You'll… so when you go to a college.

02:48:52.000 --> 02:49:00.000
Then you will be a part of culture, you build your own circle, you spend four years. I know, uh.

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:06.000
Curriculums are not up to mark, it's a rote learning that we try to do in a college, even in a school, because.

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:12.000
Uh, from a government side, this was something which should have been rectified a decade back.

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:23.000
It's not been done, but still, college holds our value, holds our power, right? Uh, maybe very soon they will change our curriculum, and which is pretty much required.

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:30.000
Uh, they will change all the teachers, they will try to modernize their entire infrastructure, which some colleges are able to do it.

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:35.000
Majority, I would say 99%, they're not able to do it. Maybe we'll have to wait for one decade more.

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:41.000
Uh, but it's a culture. For that, you pay, right? It's a hostel. You go there, you pay. It's an infrastructure, you go there, you pay.

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:48.000
You know, digital learning, if someone is teaching you how to do a vibe coding, and you are paying 3 lakh, 4 lakh rupees, that doesn't make sense to me.

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:54.000
That list. Yeah? And that, too, they will give you… even they are going to give you some certificate.

02:49:54.000 --> 02:50:03.000
You can't go and get a job on that certificate, but if college is giving you a certificate, someone will validate that, okay, fine, you have done a proper graduation.

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:12.000
So, value-wise, value proportion is different. Uh, in that 8 lakh, in other, like, 3-4 lakh, whatever it is.

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:18.000
How do we spend time for the January daily? 45 minute to 1 hour is more than enough, but yeah, discipline.

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:22.000
Okay, next one is Akhtar, please go ahead with the question.

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:30.000
Oh, yeah. Actually, I'm a RP developer. So, I'm working, uh, from last 3 to 4 years in RPA.

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:31.000
Mm-hmm.

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:37.000
So, my question is that if I'm learning geni, then how can I utilize Gen RPA?

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:38.000
And if not.

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:42.000
Okay, so first, let's learn, then we'll figure it out. Yeah, I'm sure that I will show you how to figure it out.

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:51.000
Okay. Yeah, if it is not applicable in RPA, then, uh, can I get a job in Genai itself?

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:52.000
Uh, without knowing…

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:59.000
We will get… you will get, actually, the benefit of RPA. I'll tell you, I'll show you even, right? You will be able to actually get a benefit of RPA, means your past.

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:07.000
Plus Gen AI, both. Because both are, like, pretty much, I will say, a little bit of, like, a correlation you will be able to find out.

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:08.000
Okay, and uh… like, especially in Gen AI, can we get jobs?

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:12.000
Yep. Mm-hmm.

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:13.000
Without knowing eminent deep learning.

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:24.000
Exactly, yeah. That opportunity is available, but I always suggest that try to plan that in next one year, I will be aware of machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and NLP, at least these four stack.

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:33.000
With algorithm and a practical. For the next one year, you should target. That's advice to every one of you. Everyone is literally every one of you.

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:34.000
Gotcha.

02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:42.000
Yeah, in the next one year. Not now, but you will be able to get opportunity, but in next one year, to get a better and better one.

02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:45.000
Okay. Yeah, Mustafa, please go ahead.

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:56.000
Hi, sir. Um, so basically, my question is related to, um, more in terms of the, you know, career opportunities. Nothing specific to this.

02:51:56.000 --> 02:51:57.000
Okay, hope you're liking it, liking the class.

02:51:57.000 --> 02:52:07.000
Class that we're having. So, uh… Um, yeah, sir, absolutely. In fact, I just wanted to, you know, catch up and do more, but then I understand that we have a lot of.

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:08.000
Hello, it's INC. I'll focus on every one of you, I don't have any issue. This is what I do.

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:12.000
Variety of students, so you have to take everyone together.

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:16.000
Uh, so yeah, feel free to, like, raise your question, concern, anything.

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:21.000
Sure. So basically, uh, you know, I'll give you a context about myself. I work as a.

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:33.000
Solutions Engineer, one of the AI-based startups. So, just in a very short thing, as you say, you know, testing is going, so our product itself is a, you know, agentic QA software that.

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:39.000
Automatically understand, creates test cases, and. You know, creative data, and even execute it, you can integrate with CI-CD.

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:44.000
As a solutions engineer, my role is somewhat in between business and technology.

02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:48.000
I personally like technology, so that's the reason I have taken your course.

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:49.000
Mm-hmm.

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:55.000
Um, uh, but then what IH… think whatever I'm experiencing, because we have developers, I talk to them every day.

02:52:55.000 --> 02:53:05.000
Is there, even though they're working on AI. Um, so one of the data scientists, he has joined our organization a couple of years back, but he is right now doing a core development.

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:09.000
Of software development, you know, other than integrating with LLMs and.

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:14.000
Prompts and other agentic flows, he's actually writing back-end codes as well with Python.

02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:22.000
So my concern is that I'm not from a computer science background. I'm from a mechanical engineering background, but I… entered into the software industry with the help of testing.

02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:23.000
So I did testing for some time, and then I moved to solutions engineer. So, I have 3 more years of experience, that's it.

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:28.000
Mm-hmm.

02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:33.000
But software development is, like, very, um, you know, a different.

02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:38.000
Phase for me altogether, having DSA and… And a system design, so on and so forth.

02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:43.000
So what I want to ask from you is, even if I learn these.

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:55.000
What you're telling me. It's more like a implementation, or straight-up implementation of LLMs, and… other AI-based tools, but in industry, I think people would definitely require us to have code, software development.

02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:57.000
Um, skills as well, right?

02:53:57.000 --> 02:54:04.000
Hey, okay, I think, I think we misunderstand the software development. See, software development… today we have done one website, right?

02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:12.000
So where you can go, you can check the tickets, and you can check the slots, and you can try to book this entire IPL tickets. This is called a software development.

02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:23.000
Right? So where there will be front-end, there will be back-end, there will be a middleware, right? And then, once you will club and combine each and everything, host it on a production on a scale, that is called a software development. Simple, right?

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:24.000
Hmm, hmm.

02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:30.000
Now, so, yes, people, uh, get scared by, uh, system design and DSA. Now, let me tell you one thing.

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:40.000
See, in a system design, let's suppose I'm going to understand, uh, like, a client server, client-server architecture, or maybe I'm going to talk about a cap theorem, consistency, availability, and partition tolerance, right?

02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:44.000
Uh, those are… maybe I'm going to talk about the distributed system.

02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:51.000
So, those things will not come into a picture, and never comes into a picture from a day zero.

02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:59.000
Right? And obviously, there will be an architect in your team, so who must be aware about all of these things, maybe based on his experience, his or experience, or maybe based on the exploration.

02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:12.000
So, it's not like from a day zero, you need all of those knowledge. Yes, in product development company, why they try to focus on that part, and it's a cult that people are following since a couple of, like, a decade.

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:17.000
Which is changing now, but, uh, yes, it's a trend that everyone is, like, trying to focus.

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:27.000
Because they try to apply a filtration criteria. See, you are not going to, like, use a dixtol or some crucial algorithm, BFS, DFS, or red-black tree.

02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:38.000
Right. Directly in any product. Obviously, there is a use case of all of these things. We have been using it in multiple cases, but it's a filtration, it's more like a filtration criteria on a day zero.

02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:48.000
That people are… people try to apply, so that. I will hire only this category of the people, this mindset of the people who are more logical, because they think that if you can solve a problem.

02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:59.000
Dsa, technically a mathematical problem, or something like that. You are more filtered candidate, you are more intelligent as compared to someone else.

02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:07.000
Even someone else that I'm trying to say, they are doing a software development. The one who is, like, you know, Google or Facebook, they are also doing a software development.

02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:26.000
Right? But yes, label is different, obviously. The software which Google, Facebook, and all these companies used to build is different, and the software that we are building is different, but yes, both coexist.

02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:27.000
Hmm. Hmm.

02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:34.000
What coexistences last multiple decades, and both will coexist even for a next generation C. There are people who have… whose buildings cursor, right? The cursor where, like, we are able to create the entire software, right? And still, there are some people who is trying to create a portfolio beside, or maybe they're trying to solve some of the payment gateway problem, or something like that.

02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:47.000
Yeah? So, both kind of a people. See, the people who are building a cursor, right, obviously, uh, like, they know a lot, they have a lot of experience, they are way more intelligent, they have solved so many problems, then only they are able to reach out, even they're human.

02:56:47.000 --> 02:57:03.000
Yeah? So, both kind of a people have existed till now, and it will be relevant even in a future. Now, you have to decide as an individual that what I want from my life in next one year, in next five years.

02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:04.000
Okay, so actually the thing… Yeah.

02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:12.000
And then write… try to pursue, right? Don't see someone and say that, okay, fine, so he said this. No, everyone is having its own journey, as simple as that.

02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:24.000
So, let's suppose you're targeting that, okay, index 6-month Gen AI. Let's do it, right? In next 1 year. Let's try to complete all the stack. And again, I'm not saying that keep on learning. No, not at all. Make it as a part of your life.

02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:37.000
Like, daily one hour, daily one and a half hour, simple. And believe me, it will be done in a more comfortable way, right? You don't have to even, like, you will not feel like learning something, right? You will literally enjoy in that way if you're going. Yeah, if you're sitting for 10 hours and say, I'm learning, then you are learning.

02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:43.000
Otherwise, make it like a reading of books, reading a book, uh, good philosophy book, you can say.

02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:44.000
So, uh, the next year, maybe target that, okay, fine, I'll build 4 to 5. A good.

02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:49.000
Right.

02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:58.000
Standard product, right? Maybe I'll build a streaming system, which is, again, one of the complex systems, right? Maybe I'll try to build one of the betting system.

02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:01.000
Right? Maybe I'll try to build one of the games, basically, with a lot of… so many rules.

02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:10.000
So, try to build such kind of a system, one by one, with the help of AI, with the help of copy-paste of code, no one cares. No one cares, literally, right? So, try to build it.

02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:22.000
And then you will get more and more experience. So this is how we all used to evolve in our career. This is what we all have evolved, and person who is working in a Google, so when that person has born and brought up.

02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:26.000
Basically, it's not like he was aware about us, he was aware about DSA and system design, or something like that.

02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:27.000
Mm-hmm.

02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:36.000
Like, it just… see, the majority of things that we are discussing even now, right? Majority of things has been created as a hype by an influencer.

02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:39.000
Yeah, um, sir, one more last question is… Um, so now that we are learning it.

02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:43.000
Yeah.

02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:53.000
I want to tell about myself, I cannot talk about others, but… I am personally interested, and I follow news and AI and all, so it's sort of, you know, maybe I have a shiny object syndrome.

02:58:53.000 --> 02:59:02.000
But then, um, I want a clear vision in terms of AI. Maybe there are so many different work, you know, designations, roles, and so on.

02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:13.000
Uh, if I don't have a specific goal. I… I think I might, uh, stray away, or I might spend time in some other tasks, which might not be really efficient in my goal.

02:59:13.000 --> 02:59:16.000
So to finalize that goal, I want to know how many types of.

02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:21.000
Roles are there in AI, and maybe not immediately right now, you don't need to answer, but… somewhere in there, down the line.

02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:36.000
You're gonna… no, no, I can answer now itself, so you can just go and join as a GenAI engineer, you can join as a ML engineer, you can join as a DL engineer, you can join as a vision engineer, you can join as a core NLP engineer, you can join as a research engineer, you can join as a mathematician.

02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:44.000
You can join as a data scientist on a junior, senior, managerial, lead, director, and architect level.

02:59:44.000 --> 02:59:52.000
A follow-up question on that is… Don't you think that people who are hiring for these roles would prefer somebody having a computer science background or a STE background? Because.

02:59:52.000 --> 02:59:59.000
Not at all, not at all. In our IT industry itself, 95% people are from non-computer science backgrounds.

02:59:59.000 --> 03:00:01.000
Yeah, that is true, but there aren't testing. Just kidding, this is a… no, no, no.

03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:07.000
No, who told you… who… who told… who… Who told you they're interesting?

03:00:07.000 --> 03:00:08.000
I mean…

03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:22.000
It's a myth. Just go and talk around. People who are actually developing the product. Majority of them are coming from, like, a EC background, EEE background, or some other background, civil background, mechanical background, right? And those civil guys are writing better code than the computer guy.

03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:23.000
Okay.

03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:37.000
The person who's coming from the computer in the background. So it's not about, like, a background, I would say, because whatever, you know, especially, I'll say, you know, Indian education system, till graduation, so whatever we learn, it's a total piece of shit, it's a total wastage of time. Whatever we learn.

03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:50.000
Right, so till 10th and 12th, so we try to learn, like, a math phase, chemistry, geography, biology, all of those things. I never was able to understand why, right? And then, like, we used to, like, come to a graduation where we learn 48 papers, 6 into 8, right?

03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:51.000
Yeah. Right.

03:00:51.000 --> 03:01:00.000
Eight semester, six papers per semester. Uh, and apart from that, practical, so I have not added the practical side of it. And 48 papers, and do you remember any, uh, law from thermodynamics?

03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:01.000
I just don't remember the name of the thermody. Yeah.

03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:09.000
It's like… doesn't name, right? Just on the… yeah, do you remember which book you have followed in thermodynamics?

03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:10.000
Uh, no, I just remember, let us see us in on the books.

03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:13.000
Exactly. Exactly, right? We all have gone to thermodynamics in our first semester.

03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:17.000
Yeah. Thanks.

03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:18.000
Two semesters, yeah.

03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:35.000
Doesn't matter which branch we were into. Exactly, right? That's the problem with the education system. So, we used to invest energy and time in some, like, a… and some of these things… a majority of time, right, time where we, as a human being, are very, very energetic. A person in the age of 20, 22, 24 are very, very energized.

03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:36.000
And you can't expect the same kind of energy from a 40-year-old.

03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:39.000
Yeah. Yeah.

03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:53.000
Right. They feel burned out. But yeah, so when we were, like, too much energetic, at that point of a time, we were exploring 48 different, different subjects, and good day when you come to this year, and out of the college, you realize that.

03:01:53.000 --> 03:02:03.000
I don't even remember the name of the books. And not even a single formula. Do you remember Archimedes' principle? A buoyancy principle?

03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:04.000
What was that?

03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:12.000
Uh, buencias, I remember. So… So, the amount of volume displaced by an object inside a water is equal to the force experienced by it against.

03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:16.000
Figured I would be. I guess it's, like… And the word ways up.

03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:19.000
90%, only 90% correct. Only 90% correct. There are 10% mistake, right.

03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:21.000
Goode.

03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:32.000
So, see, that is a reality of the education system we are living in, too, right? And so, I will say, it's not about the background or the branch, it's all about.

03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:42.000
That, uh, when you have started, because majority of people who are writing a code, right, they have started writing a code, at least in Indian culture, right? Not in the US, not in the EU culture, because there, they are writing a quote since their childhood.

03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:43.000
Hmm…

03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:51.000
Especially in the Indian culture, we have started writing a code, a real one, after our graduation. And maybe after graduation.

03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:52.000
Exactly. Yeah.

03:02:52.000 --> 03:03:01.000
Even after, like, 2-3 years after that. Right? That's a big problem. That's a big problem, but yeah, we can't solve it as an individual, but yeah, that problem exists. And this is not the same culture that we follow outside.

03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:13.000
Yeah. That's it, sir. I think, uh, but, uh, I would suggest that if here and there, you can add some more practical insights about your, maybe, students who have already gotten out from your own.

03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:22.000
Uh, something, some, some, uh, industry-level experience that what they have felt, or what they have experienced, I think that might add more… knowledge, because we are having very…

03:03:22.000 --> 03:03:32.000
I think, I think… I think there are enough people in your group, so you can chat to them, and they will… they will… That's the reason we have a WhatsApp group, right?

03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:38.000
I hope all of you are enjoying this conversation, guys. Believe me, in all the doubling session, you all will enjoy.

03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:49.000
It'll be fun, it'll be like a mind relaxing for all of you. And yes, it will look like a podcast for you, so every day, a Saturday to Sunday podcast. After 2 hours… but after my lecture.

03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:56.000
I'll never do this kind of podcast during my lecture. No one means literally never.

03:03:56.000 --> 03:04:03.000
Okay, so mace, please go ahead with your question. After that, uh, cars or someone? Who was… Alvini. Yeah, Aswini can go ahead.

03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:06.000
As Dan, so are you able to hear me? I'm… Okay. Thank you.

03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:08.000
Yeah, yeah, I can hear you, Sumice.

03:04:08.000 --> 03:04:22.000
So, I have a couple of questions. So, basically, the one, uh, I guess, this, uh, on the class itself, it was going pretty fast, so, um, so when you generated the code in the, uh, cursor.

03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:23.000
Mm-hmm.

03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:30.000
And, uh, how you ran it in the Firebase? Uh, to display as a web page. Can you…

03:04:30.000 --> 03:04:41.000
No, no, no, I never run… I never ran that in Firebase, actually. So, basically, see… Uh, when I have executed in cursor, so it is giving me a end point in my local host, right? Filebase was online, right? See, at the end of the day, I have just asked it to execute it and show me the final.

03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:47.000
Okay.

03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:55.000
Give me the final port. So, basically, it has given me my local O3000, as you can see, it's still, it's running. So, this is my local host, not a Firebase, not a global system.

03:04:55.000 --> 03:04:56.000
Okay, okay. Okay, okay.

03:04:56.000 --> 03:05:04.000
Right, see, I'm running in my local, this one.

03:05:04.000 --> 03:05:05.000
Yeah, I have asked to, like, test it. I have asked to test it, debug it, and then, like, deploy, uh, like, launch it, basically.

03:05:05.000 --> 03:05:10.000
So after the code got generated, you have asked to provide the local…

03:05:10.000 --> 03:05:17.000
So it has launched NPM run. Launch command is simple, it was an NPM run, an NPM build, so it has launched it on 3000 port. Simple.

03:05:17.000 --> 03:05:19.000
Okay, okay. Sure, sure.

03:05:19.000 --> 03:05:25.000
We'll do it, we'll do it in a class so many times, don't worry. I know these things are, like, pretty much new for most of us, but yeah, we'll do it.

03:05:25.000 --> 03:05:26.000
We'll do a lot of it.

03:05:26.000 --> 03:05:31.000
And in this cursor, like, initially, as per the initial prompt, you have given, like.

03:05:31.000 --> 03:05:40.000
Um, you want to generate the whole, uh, code in a Python language and everything, but it still gave you in a Node.js format.

03:05:40.000 --> 03:05:41.000
So.

03:05:41.000 --> 03:05:44.000
No, I… so, I have done that over there, so when I was generating the entire prompt, right? So, at that point of time. So, see, if you will observe my prompt over here, I have not even mentioned my technology stack.

03:05:44.000 --> 03:05:53.000
Mm-hmm.

03:05:53.000 --> 03:05:54.000
Okay.

03:05:54.000 --> 03:05:59.000
So, by default, it has selected our monostack. So I have done that when I was chatting with a Yuri, not here. So, nowhere I have mentioned the technology stack, by the way.

03:05:59.000 --> 03:06:04.000
If I would have mentioned that, that use Python for a backend, use this particular databases, and use this, this, this.

03:06:04.000 --> 03:06:07.000
Then we would have selected only that one.

03:06:07.000 --> 03:06:24.000
Okay, okay, got it, got it. And one basic question, uh, see, when we are using, uh, VS Code or the… cursor. So, while typing in the prompt, you can see there is a model and the agent, the configure mode, okay?

03:06:24.000 --> 03:06:39.000
Because yesterday, someone asked me the question, uh, what is basically the difference between the ask agent and the model? Because, uh, when… when we are normally asking any question, and we have to particularly select, if… if there is… suppose there is no auto mode or something.

03:06:39.000 --> 03:06:42.000
We have to select a model, uh, so we want…

03:06:42.000 --> 03:06:48.000
But it's what we call the agent. See, even in auto mode, agents are nothing but a piece of program.

03:06:48.000 --> 03:06:49.000
Yeah.

03:06:49.000 --> 03:06:55.000
Right? So, for example, if I'll go here, and let's suppose if I'm going to write one, like, a piece of the code.

03:06:55.000 --> 03:07:04.000
For example, that def, uh… elaborate.

03:07:04.000 --> 03:07:18.000
Elaborate kind of a function, so where it is going to take my, like, uh, uh… text as an input, and then here, so it should take maybe, like, uh… something… let me convert this one itself.

03:07:18.000 --> 03:07:20.000
So, let's suppose this is a generate completion, right? So, I'll copy the same code.

03:07:20.000 --> 03:07:23.000
Okay.

03:07:23.000 --> 03:07:34.000
I'll just change it. Change it, and uh… here…

03:07:34.000 --> 03:07:46.000
Elaborate, and then here. So… Give me a… Oblited prompt.

03:07:46.000 --> 03:07:51.000
For all the input.

03:07:51.000 --> 03:08:11.000
Input, and then the input is going to be… Text, I'm going to convert that into a text, TXT text, and formatted string over here.

03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:12.000
Okay.

03:08:12.000 --> 03:08:22.000
Okay, it will be able to… So, see, I have just changed this function, so I'm just trying to give, like, I have made it as an input-driven, right? And then I'm saying that, that I'm giving a prompt that, okay, so give me a liberated prompt for all the input, means whatever input I'm going to give, it will hit my model, right, it will hit my model, basically, so which is.

03:08:22.000 --> 03:08:27.000
Technically hitting my, like, this particular model, GPT 4.1 Nano model, and it is going to give me the elaborated response.

03:08:27.000 --> 03:08:30.000
So this is our function I have created. Now, let me call this function.

03:08:30.000 --> 03:08:41.000
Elaborate, and then here, so I'm going to, like, uh, maybe, uh, I'm going to provide.

03:08:41.000 --> 03:08:44.000
This one. Let's suppose, right? This one I'm going to provide.

03:08:44.000 --> 03:08:45.000
So it's a multi-line, so let me change it to the multi-line.

03:08:45.000 --> 03:08:49.000
Yeah.

03:08:49.000 --> 03:08:57.000
Yeah, so I'm going to call this one with this input. Same thing we have given inside the cursor, and here is a command. Now, this command will go into the… this is… this will go into the LLMs, basically.

03:08:57.000 --> 03:09:08.000
Now, so it will do what? So, technically, it will try to elaborate this entire input point. Now, what is my model? My model is this one. What is my agent?

03:09:08.000 --> 03:09:16.000
So you can say that, that this function is behaving like an agent. So, I have written this function.

03:09:16.000 --> 03:09:17.000
Okay. Okay.

03:09:17.000 --> 03:09:27.000
For a specific purpose. Getting my point? So, inside a cursor, when I say there is an agent, so there are multiple agent systems they are using it. So, some agent which will do a research, some agent which will do a search, some agent which will try to invoke your.

03:09:27.000 --> 03:09:36.000
Basically a terminal, some agent which will try to test your code, it will try to fix, or it will try to generate the next version of the code, a fixed code, a elaborated one.

03:09:36.000 --> 03:09:40.000
So, and some agent which will try to elaborate the input that you have given, the way… So, basically, agent will not be able to work without a LLM access.

03:09:40.000 --> 03:09:47.000
It is like a combination of the model and the agent who get the…

03:09:47.000 --> 03:09:48.000
Okay, okay.

03:09:48.000 --> 03:09:57.000
So that's the reason we say agentic AI system, right? And even in our classes, so we are going to talk about Lang Chen, Llama indexes. Eventually, what we'll do? We'll create a multiple agents.

03:09:57.000 --> 03:10:05.000
Right? And those agents will be having an access of API… through an API key, they will be able to access a different, different kind of a model.

03:10:05.000 --> 03:10:06.000
Go to… go to, yeah.

03:10:06.000 --> 03:10:14.000
Right? Same like this one. See, I have used our model, so model is one part. Model is basically a LLM, which understands the entire world, and it understands your natural language as well.

03:10:14.000 --> 03:10:20.000
So whatever, like, English text or any language you are going to write down. Now, agent is nothing but. I have just.

03:10:20.000 --> 03:10:26.000
Configured this one for a specific task, that it will do what? It will always elaborate.

03:10:26.000 --> 03:10:27.000
Yes? If I'm going to say, do something different, maybe do a real-time search, whatever input I'm going to give you.

03:10:27.000 --> 03:10:32.000
Got it, yeah.

03:10:32.000 --> 03:10:41.000
I'll just say that, that do always are real-time research. Now, this agent, if this kind of agent, I can say that, okay, fine, so create this kind of an image for me.

03:10:41.000 --> 03:10:42.000
Mm-hmm.

03:10:42.000 --> 03:10:49.000
With this flavor. So, agents are eventually a kind of a function, as of now, just trying to understand, when we'll create, we'll get more into depth.

03:10:49.000 --> 03:11:01.000
So, agent is a kind of just a system. So, you should do something on their own. Going forward, I'll try to even add a couple of more things with respect to agent. That agents can take a decision automatically. As of now, it's a very linear decision.

03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:10.000
Only one kind of things it has to do, right? But let's suppose I have to do multiple things. An agent is supposed to decide automatically that out of these 10 things, what I'm supposed to do.

03:11:10.000 --> 03:11:11.000
So, agent will be able to do that as well, which I'll add.

03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:13.000
Okay.

03:11:13.000 --> 03:11:18.000
But as of now, just try to understand that it's just a function which is trying to invoke your models.

03:11:18.000 --> 03:11:21.000
Simple. So, the cursor is doing the exact same thing.

03:11:21.000 --> 03:11:26.000
Got it, got it. And, uh, thanks for that. Oh, one final question.

03:11:26.000 --> 03:11:34.000
So, uh, see, when the cursor is generating such a huge code base, okay.

03:11:34.000 --> 03:11:40.000
So it is, uh, a developer responsibility to go through all the security checks, because anyway, it'll be doing.

03:11:40.000 --> 03:11:50.000
But suppose your company's requirement might be different. So, uh… so for any case of hallucination or some details, you need to check from our end, or that also can be given in the prompt.

03:11:50.000 --> 03:12:02.000
Uh, you can try to give anything in a prompt, whichever comes in your mind, but yes, you have to follow all the SOPs, or all the standard approach that your company is going to define, or that your client is looking for.

03:12:02.000 --> 03:12:08.000
Always. So, you can do it with the help of prompt, or maybe you can do it manually, but you'll have to do it.

03:12:08.000 --> 03:12:13.000
And yeah, as far as prompting is concerned, so you can give a prompt.

03:12:13.000 --> 03:12:14.000
Okay, okay. Thank you, good. Thank you very much.

03:12:14.000 --> 03:12:24.000
Basically. Yeah. Yeah, thanks. Nas, uh, yes, uh, so next one is, Aswini, please go ahead with your question.

03:12:24.000 --> 03:12:25.000
Yes, Vinnie. Yeah, good morning.

03:12:25.000 --> 03:12:40.000
Hello? Hi, sir, good morning. So, I have some question on rags. I'm building on, uh… I'm working on a problem statement, and… In the rag, I just want to know that, uh, embedding while doing the embedding for vector database.

03:12:40.000 --> 03:12:47.000
Is it important to choose some, uh, model like GPT, or we can go with an open source?

03:12:47.000 --> 03:12:48.000
So, eh…

03:12:48.000 --> 03:13:00.000
You can go with open source, you know, Hugging Face, there are tons of models, thousands of models are available for embeddings. You can go with any models, but yeah. So, if you are looking… see, embedding means what? You are converting some sentences into a vector space, means into a numeric. But that is not the only meaning, right?

03:13:00.000 --> 03:13:13.000
Uh, if I'm using a better model, so better model simply means that it has been trained on a lot of data, right? So, it understands your grammatical, it understands your phrasing, it understands the parsing, it understands the punctuation, and relationship between those words.

03:13:13.000 --> 03:13:23.000
Right, at those tokens, better way. So, it's always better to go with the best of best model, then only you will be able to build a better embedding. If you're going with the basic one.

03:13:23.000 --> 03:13:33.000
Obviously, it can generate, uh, like, a numeric space, but just generating something into a numeric space is not just a requirement, right?

03:13:33.000 --> 03:13:34.000
So that's the reason Gov with the best, but yeah, options are, like, thousands on Hugging Face.

03:13:34.000 --> 03:13:38.000
Right. So, in…

03:13:38.000 --> 03:13:44.000
Sir, I have a huge amount of data, so I cannot go with a free source. That's the reason I'm using, uh.

03:13:44.000 --> 03:13:51.000
Some paid services for embedding. So, I just want to know one more thing, that embedding directly affects the response, right?

03:13:51.000 --> 03:13:57.000
Embedding is one of the factors which will affect the matching. A similarity search, basically.

03:13:57.000 --> 03:14:02.000
Okay. So, what are the factors we have to check, like, for the response part?

03:14:02.000 --> 03:14:12.000
Context… context over… context overlapping, you have to check, basically, embedding the input dimension that you try to provide, so that is, again, going to factor a lot.

03:14:12.000 --> 03:14:21.000
The similarity such algorithm that it is using, so whether it's using a Hamilton distance or it is using a cosine similarity, again, uh, that matters. So, there are, like.

03:14:21.000 --> 03:14:24.000
10, 12 factor, I can name it. Likewise?

03:14:24.000 --> 03:14:39.000
Okay, so, uh, so prompt engineering, whatever the prompt we are, uh, we are using for the response, that also affects the response, right, sir?

03:14:39.000 --> 03:14:40.000
Yes, ma'am. Mm-hmm.

03:14:40.000 --> 03:14:47.000
Prompt, obviously, it is going to affect, because prompt itself will get converted to a vector, and it'll go for the matching, right, which is available with the data which is available into your databases, VectorDB, basically, right? So, prompt is one of the factors, but before that, when we create an embedding.

03:14:47.000 --> 03:14:53.000
Again, many factors comes into picture. Even before prompting. Prompto is always a fact. Prompt is always a factor, even with chatting.

03:14:53.000 --> 03:14:57.000
Augusta…

03:14:57.000 --> 03:15:11.000
Augustus, you told, uh, right before creating the embedding some factor effects, so will you brief me that thing?

03:15:11.000 --> 03:15:12.000
I said, I've seen that… sir, I've seen that video, that's the reason I asked.

03:15:12.000 --> 03:15:23.000
Come to the ROG class, I'll explain it to you. Yep. We have RSG class in this one itself. Like I said, so wherever you're trying to… No, so come to this one as well, live lecture. Even in this curriculum, I have mentioned RAG.

03:15:23.000 --> 03:15:35.000
Yeah. Okay, next one, please. Uh, Sivam, please go ahead.

03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:39.000
Yeah, so next one, Prakas, Nihal, and now I think anyone can go.

03:15:39.000 --> 03:15:41.000
Yeah. Hi, Bragas.

03:15:41.000 --> 03:15:49.000
Hey, I should understand. Yeah, so first, uh, I have two questions. So, first question, like, uh, I joined today only, after some 10 o'clock.

03:15:49.000 --> 03:15:52.000
Okay, okay.

03:15:52.000 --> 03:15:56.000
I haven't noticed, uh, this, uh, post-launch previously, so suddenly I joined today.

03:15:56.000 --> 03:15:57.000
Okay, okay, thank you.

03:15:57.000 --> 03:16:05.000
And the reason why I've done this course, uh. I was part of iNeuron, uh.

03:16:05.000 --> 03:16:06.000
Okay. Okay.

03:16:06.000 --> 03:16:11.000
Data science course in 2020. Sorry, 2021. At the time, I joined in KPMG.

03:16:11.000 --> 03:16:16.000
Uh, so due to some reasons, after 3 months, I'm not able to continue.

03:16:16.000 --> 03:16:17.000
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

03:16:17.000 --> 03:16:23.000
So I just asked some basics of YAML and, uh… A few other things. Statistics model kind of thing.

03:16:23.000 --> 03:16:24.000
Okay.

03:16:24.000 --> 03:16:30.000
Now, I'm currently working with KPMJ, and I'm trying to build some chat assistant kind of thing.

03:16:30.000 --> 03:16:31.000
So, just… I wanted to explore more into the GenAI things.

03:16:31.000 --> 03:16:35.000
Mm-hmm.

03:16:35.000 --> 03:16:36.000
Mm-hmm, okay.

03:16:36.000 --> 03:16:44.000
So that is the reason I mainly joined this course, and uh… Uh, so, first of all, uh, what are the things I need to do, uh, from yesterday? Like, today only I joined.

03:16:44.000 --> 03:17:01.000
Nothing, nothing. Yesterday, we just had a paid form demo, right? And as you are the old one, so you know that on a very first day, I just give an intro. Uh, right, and we do a chit-chat a lot, and then from today onwards, I have started a curriculum, a basic one, basically, like, uh, system setup and everything. So, so far, nothing. It's fine.

03:17:01.000 --> 03:17:05.000
Like, uh, nothing you have to do from your end.

03:17:05.000 --> 03:17:17.000
Okay, okay. Yes, Valencia. So, uh, the industry level, like, uh, so since I'm working on capabilities, so there is a lot of things coming into the picture, like, uh, everyone trying to explore and generate things.

03:17:17.000 --> 03:17:18.000
Hmm.

03:17:18.000 --> 03:17:26.000
But it is kind of, uh, just in terms of words, like, uh, we are trying to do large… more into the kind of chat assistant things, like, we are having our own tax data.

03:17:26.000 --> 03:17:31.000
We'll build a lot, we'll build it, don't worry. We'll try to build it. I don't believe in exploration.

03:17:31.000 --> 03:17:36.000
So, build it. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, yeah.

03:17:36.000 --> 03:17:45.000
So, Pushkar, Amir, go ahead, anyone? Any… anyone? Yes. Yeah, hi, Buscar. Yes, go ahead.

03:17:45.000 --> 03:17:50.000
So, what would you think that, uh, how many years this JNA will last for?

03:17:50.000 --> 03:17:52.000
So, how many a year?

03:17:52.000 --> 03:18:00.000
This general rule will, uh, is… what we say, last fall.

03:18:00.000 --> 03:18:01.000
I think, like, like, I'm thinking…

03:18:01.000 --> 03:18:09.000
I don't know how many, like, years it will last long, but… I believe AI is going to evolve more and more, and even after 10 year, AI will keep on evolving.

03:18:09.000 --> 03:18:34.000
Uh, the trend I have seen in the last, like, uh, 11 years of my career. So, I have started, uh, like, as a SAP guy, then big data guy, and then, like, uh, as a data science guy. I think six, seven, seven years back, and yeah, since then, I'm teaching. I've seen a lot, like, at that point of a time, AI was not that popular. We used, like, use a statistical model, mathematical model. We used to build a lot, and then computer vision came into a picture.

03:18:34.000 --> 03:18:44.000
So, keeping current trend in our mind, uh… I don't know whether Gen AI as a position will be available or not, but AI will exist for sure.

03:18:44.000 --> 03:18:45.000
And if AI exists, maybe someone will derive some new term.

03:18:45.000 --> 03:18:48.000
Okay, like, I mean, uh…

03:18:48.000 --> 03:18:56.000
Like, I mean, I've seen in terms of, like, a year… engineering, you know, like, Jenai.

03:18:56.000 --> 03:18:57.000
But, uh, we are actually still are…

03:18:57.000 --> 03:19:04.000
So, see, there was a data scientist, there was a M… Yeah, there was a data scientist, there was a machine learning agent, there was a CV engineer, computer vision engineer, and LP engineer. That does exist even now.

03:19:04.000 --> 03:19:09.000
Right? So even after, like, an 8-10 year, I'm able to see that there does exist… that profile exists, right.

03:19:09.000 --> 03:19:16.000
Uh, then there was… there is a new addition of this Gen AI engineer. The Gen AI engineer never existed, like, two years… two and a half years back.

03:19:16.000 --> 03:19:23.000
Right. Uh, there was a new term, I'm, like, getting nowadays, prompt engineers. I don't know what they do, but yeah.

03:19:23.000 --> 03:19:29.000
There is a… I know, like, all of you must have heard about this term called as prompt engineering.

03:19:29.000 --> 03:19:30.000
Yes.

03:19:30.000 --> 03:19:36.000
Right. Then, there is a new term that we started getting, Vivecoder. Today, we have seen live coding, right? So now we all have become… today we all become VIP coder.

03:19:36.000 --> 03:19:40.000
If…

03:19:40.000 --> 03:19:45.000
Right? So, people will keep on deriving the term. Under the hood, things are the same.

03:19:45.000 --> 03:19:49.000
Right, it's just an evolution that we are trying to follow along with.

03:19:49.000 --> 03:19:55.000
So, just like to follow along wherever you will be, you will be in a good position with a good title. Simple.

03:19:55.000 --> 03:20:01.000
The answer, there is another one question that was… What do you think about the bed?

03:20:01.000 --> 03:20:02.000
What… What do you… what do you think about?

03:20:02.000 --> 03:20:10.000
Like, change data science or linear bitch. Facebook, Amazon, Google, Microsoft.

03:20:10.000 --> 03:20:11.000
Um, see, they're, they're… They're firing, they're hiring, so that will be continued. There is nothing new in that.

03:20:11.000 --> 03:20:18.000
Regarding a data science or gene, but, like, specific template.

03:20:18.000 --> 03:20:26.000
All right, uh, you don't need, like, a 10,000 job, you just need only one, right?

03:20:26.000 --> 03:20:27.000
No, no, I'm talking about your backstop, like, uh… You're on bootcamp regarding the bank.

03:20:27.000 --> 03:20:31.000
Secure that one.

03:20:31.000 --> 03:20:42.000
See, you will be able to learn all the particular aspect of each and everything, right? But yeah, so to get into those fang-Fung kind of a company, uh, you have to, like, focus on not just this one, which is a core part.

03:20:42.000 --> 03:20:52.000
Along with this, you will have to… you will be able to clear two or three rounds with the help of this one, but the very first two rounds will be from DSN system design, so you have to focus on that one.

03:20:52.000 --> 03:21:01.000
A harsh reality. Yeah. Ramesh Kumar, yeah, you can speak, yes, yes, you can speak. I don't have any issue.

03:21:01.000 --> 03:21:05.000
Yeah.

03:21:05.000 --> 03:21:09.000
Uh, sir, actually, my current project is for Microsoft, generally. Uh, so it is here, I'm working as.

03:21:09.000 --> 03:21:11.000
Okay.

03:21:11.000 --> 03:21:15.000
Uh, so we have given some use cases to proposed term clients.

03:21:15.000 --> 03:21:22.000
But the client would want to go with some co-pilot or something, what they have the one tool.

03:21:22.000 --> 03:21:26.000
So, in this case, how this course will be really helpful to me, that.

03:21:26.000 --> 03:21:27.000
So you can just read once again what was… what was the problem statement.

03:21:27.000 --> 03:21:37.000
So, in my larger… My problem statement in my current project, right, we are not using any open source tool.

03:21:37.000 --> 03:21:46.000
So, basically, we are using the… they are encouraging to use the… their own tool, Microsoft tool. They are not allowing to use any open source tool.

03:21:46.000 --> 03:21:56.000
So even if I'm promoting all the use cases, right, which one… Uh, we can get the use cases from, uh, website as well, but it's not… they're not agreeing with that.

03:21:56.000 --> 03:22:04.000
So, how can I propose the use cases with this specific project level there?

03:22:04.000 --> 03:22:05.000
Yeah, yeah, they would suggest with Copilot or something, their one tool.

03:22:05.000 --> 03:22:15.000
So, basically, proprietary tool they are asking you to create. This is… something that…

03:22:15.000 --> 03:22:16.000
Yeah.

03:22:16.000 --> 03:22:27.000
Copilot is, like, yeah, I'm like, it's a big company, so obviously, like, they are providing co-pilot, so go ahead with Copilot, that's completely fine. Copilot is also going to give you, like, a… Lot of help in terms of generating a code, code completion, code testing, and then, like, building the entire end-to-end pipeline. But with Copilot, that's completely fine.

03:22:27.000 --> 03:22:29.000
So, do we also cover the co-pilot as part of the syllabus?

03:22:29.000 --> 03:22:36.000
I'll… just remind me, like, next week itself, I'll do a demo of Copilot. The way I have done the demo of this cursor, right?

03:22:36.000 --> 03:22:42.000
It will be very quick. It's like a very quick. I'll be using, like, a co-pilot.

03:22:42.000 --> 03:22:43.000
Yeah.

03:22:43.000 --> 03:22:48.000
Okay, cool. Because we don't, yeah, we don't have the platform, practical platform to export it, so most of the material.

03:22:48.000 --> 03:22:49.000
I'll show it to you, I'll just… Yeah, just give me the reminder, it will not take more than, like, a 10-15 minute of time. Just give me a reminder next week.

03:22:49.000 --> 03:22:56.000
We can improve that.

03:22:56.000 --> 03:23:00.000
Yeah, yeah, thanks. Okay, anyone? Next? Yeah, I go ahead, Nikhil.

03:23:00.000 --> 03:23:06.000
Hi, sir. This is… Actually, I'm from Automotive domain.

03:23:06.000 --> 03:23:07.000
Mm-hmm.

03:23:07.000 --> 03:23:21.000
Trying to switch for company for Gen AI, I said, like, I have done a little bit RAP project and all, but that guy said we'll not consider that one. Did you actually work in Production Gate or POC like that?

03:23:21.000 --> 03:23:32.000
Uh, nowadays, no one is, like, if you said that, like, I have worked on a small project, no one, like, cares about it, because everyone knows that those small projects can be created easily in 5 minutes of time.

03:23:32.000 --> 03:23:33.000
That is not God has given experience.

03:23:33.000 --> 03:23:41.000
Yep. Yeah, but they're asking in company only, did you do, or not? They're not asking outside project also if I do…

03:23:41.000 --> 03:23:48.000
Yeah, so if you have done some, like, production-grade things, you can say that, okay, fine, this is something which I have done in a company.

03:23:48.000 --> 03:23:55.000
Yeah, but they're asking if you worker in company only, we will, uh, consider, uh, apart from that, we will not consider only, so it's difficult for me to switch.

03:23:55.000 --> 03:24:06.000
See, whatever you will say, they will consider. They are not going to come and ask your manager or your lead that whether you have built this project or not, because no one… talks about that in outside, right?

03:24:06.000 --> 03:24:07.000
Yeah.

03:24:07.000 --> 03:24:13.000
So, whatever you will say, they will believe. So, you have to say that, okay, fine, this is something which I have done in a company, and they will believe it if you're able to prove it.

03:24:13.000 --> 03:24:33.000
Yeah, another one question is, like you said, the core basics is important, right? I used to learn that Python and all 1, 2, 3 weeks, so… After some time only, I got to know that the tier is equal to 10 variable usually will not store, it will refer to that variable, so that much deep should I go in learning how it will go, Python memory management, back-end stuff?

03:24:33.000 --> 03:24:41.000
Uh, with the time you will go into that, on a day zero, so I don't think that we should go into that depth. We should take that kind of burden.

03:24:41.000 --> 03:24:49.000
Because sometimes what happens is we as a human being are not ready for that.

03:24:49.000 --> 03:24:50.000
Yeah.

03:24:50.000 --> 03:25:05.000
So it's fine, like, a workaround… will be good. Just try to, like, uh, do it. Get into a job, and then you will learn a lot. Learning is not going to end till you… Until you, like, retire, right? So…

03:25:05.000 --> 03:25:06.000
We all do… we'll all do it, yes. Yeah. Yeah.

03:25:06.000 --> 03:25:10.000
You are, uh, telling, like, for basics, learn these things and start learning Gen AI after getting job, also, you can do that one. So, focus on… Thank you, thank you for the suggestion, yeah.

03:25:10.000 --> 03:25:12.000
Okay, next one, guys, anyone? Atul, go ahead. Yeah.

03:25:12.000 --> 03:25:21.000
Yeah, yeah, highest response. So, I am… yeah, uh… a student of your first batch in machine learning.

03:25:21.000 --> 03:25:22.000
So, yes, so… Uh, 19.

03:25:22.000 --> 03:25:27.000
Okay. Oh, amazing. 2019 or 2020? Okay, 19, okay, that's amazing.

03:25:27.000 --> 03:25:33.000
Yeah, so after that, like, I switched in my… and, uh, like, I learned machine learning, deep learning, AI, uh, like, NLP.

03:25:33.000 --> 03:25:38.000
Every… everyone is… everyone is looking for another toothy transition, okay? Fine, we'll do it. We'll do it together.

03:25:38.000 --> 03:25:39.000
So, after that, like, the, uh, I switched in the data engineering part.

03:25:39.000 --> 03:25:43.000
We have done that part.

03:25:43.000 --> 03:25:50.000
Like, on that time, I did not get much, uh… a good job in the, like, data science.

03:25:50.000 --> 03:26:00.000
So, as of now, I, like, tried to switch in the GN AI all things, so I thought, like, you were starting new ads, so I just joined. So today, I joined just, uh, 10 minutes ago.

03:26:00.000 --> 03:26:01.000
So I, like, I miss… Yes.

03:26:01.000 --> 03:26:05.000
Now, you're the oldest friend, you are already aware about the culture, so it's fine. Welcome, welcome back once again.

03:26:05.000 --> 03:26:06.000
Yes, yeah. So I just asked, like, uh, I miss your last class, and uh…

03:26:06.000 --> 03:26:15.000
Yeah? Where you… where you taught in 2019, where I taught, Atul, it was Ainar, right?

03:26:15.000 --> 03:26:18.000
Yeah. Yes, sir. So, on that time, I was in Gurdam.

03:26:18.000 --> 03:26:23.000
Yeah. It was a company which I sold to Physics Allah into Hutika Road, so…

03:26:23.000 --> 03:26:29.000
Yes, yes, yeah. So I knew Don, like, uh, I have all… as of now, I have the access of the i9 classes.

03:26:29.000 --> 03:26:31.000
Again, thanks to PW.

03:26:31.000 --> 03:26:35.000
Yes, yeah. Okay, sir. So, I just asked, like, I got the recording of yesterday class and today's class.

03:26:35.000 --> 03:26:48.000
Okay, yeah. Yeah, it's already… so for studies class, it's already uploaded, and for today's class, I'll be uploading it after, like, a… 3 hours after the completion… closer of this batch.

03:26:48.000 --> 03:26:49.000
Okay, okay, sir. Haha.

03:26:49.000 --> 03:26:58.000
Yeah, so it really is same, same thing we do. Okay, so next one, anyone, guys? Ganesh, Visal, anyone? You have raised your hand.

03:26:58.000 --> 03:27:05.000
Yeah. So, my question is… April nurse Vince, they are taking admission in B or B take.

03:27:05.000 --> 03:27:06.000
Okay. Mm-hmm.

03:27:06.000 --> 03:27:13.000
Suppose they are planning for AI courses. In that case, the institute, they are charging $7,800.

03:27:13.000 --> 03:27:14.000
Mm-hmm.

03:27:14.000 --> 03:27:20.000
If they are going in at that speed, like, uh, a normal decay, sorry, the mechanical.

03:27:20.000 --> 03:27:28.000
Is it looking at anything? And they are charging, like, 3 lakhs and 4 less. So, what do you suggest? They should go with the normal and join your course, that will be enough?

03:27:28.000 --> 03:27:37.000
See, that is… anyhow, doesn't matter whether you are going to join a 7 lakh college or, like, uh, who charges the fees for 1 lakh, right?

03:27:37.000 --> 03:27:50.000
Uh, at the end of the day, we join a college not for a learning, because no one asked that what kind of a teacher you have. Obviously, when you join a private institute like us, you do ask a question that, okay, like, uh.

03:27:50.000 --> 03:27:59.000
Uh, basically, like, what kind of a teacher, what is your result, but generally, with respect to college, we see their placement track record, that how many companies they are calling.

03:27:59.000 --> 03:28:05.000
What kind of, you know, culture that you have, what kind of infrastructure that you have, what kind of a food you are going to provide to my kids.

03:28:05.000 --> 03:28:10.000
Or, like, uh, what kind of a hostel facilities you will be able to get, and then based on the affordability of the.

03:28:10.000 --> 03:28:14.000
Family and persons or, uh, people used to go and choose.

03:28:14.000 --> 03:28:31.000
So, selection of college is not about just a learning outcome, because that is the… least border thing, although I, like, my thoughts are completely opposed to it, but I'm just talking about the general thought, right? How we think and.

03:28:31.000 --> 03:28:36.000
When I was choosing my college, so what was the criteria to choose my college at that point of a time?

03:28:36.000 --> 03:28:45.000
And even, same thing, like, people used to do. So, it's not about learning. Learning nowadays, you have a kind of an ecosystem online, so where.

03:28:45.000 --> 03:28:50.000
You will be able to access our best and best of the.

03:28:50.000 --> 03:29:02.000
World's knowledge, with a person, everything, right? Personal infrastructure. But yeah, uh, you should know that what I should learn, what will be my, like, milestones, what I should complete.

03:29:02.000 --> 03:29:08.000
And us are not ready for that. Many of us are not ready for a self-exploration.

03:29:08.000 --> 03:29:15.000
So this is where this environment comes into picture. So if… your child, or your neighbor, or anyone, right, to whom you're recommending or suggesting.

03:29:15.000 --> 03:29:22.000
If the person is a kind of a person who can explore on themselves, then.

03:29:22.000 --> 03:29:27.000
Obviously, you can go ahead with the route number 2, which very few people will take.

03:29:27.000 --> 03:29:32.000
Uh, if you are not that kind of a person, then obviously you need an environment.

03:29:32.000 --> 03:29:39.000
So, where, uh, things will go in a predefined manner, in a step-by-step manner, doesn't matter how much it is going to charge.

03:29:39.000 --> 03:29:46.000
There are colleges, right? They're offering CSS, CS in just, like, a 1 lakh rupees, 2 lakh rupees. There are colleges.

03:29:46.000 --> 03:29:51.000
But maybe their infrastructure is not that great, like, their hostel facilities, their campus is not that great.

03:29:51.000 --> 03:29:56.000
So, people are charging you for those facilities, not for education, believe me.

03:29:56.000 --> 03:30:04.000
Those 7 lakhs are never for… was never meant for education at all.

03:30:04.000 --> 03:30:08.000
Yeah, I hope I'm able to answer your question. So, which one you should choose?

03:30:08.000 --> 03:30:09.000
Yes.

03:30:09.000 --> 03:30:15.000
Depends upon the instrument caliber. Just choose that. And obviously, like, money matters a lot, right? 7 lakh is not a small amount.

03:30:15.000 --> 03:30:22.000
So… that matters. People are charging, like, somewhere 20 lakh as well, for per year.

03:30:22.000 --> 03:30:27.000
Yeah. Yeah. Next one, like, Vishal, please go ahead.

03:30:27.000 --> 03:30:28.000
Good morning, sir. Good afternoon, sir.

03:30:28.000 --> 03:30:33.000
Yeah, good evening, good… yeah. Cartoon, yeah. Go ahead, please.

03:30:33.000 --> 03:30:35.000
So, can I share my screen?

03:30:35.000 --> 03:30:42.000
Yeah, you can share your screen, so let me make you a panelist. You will be joining as a panelist in a few minutes.

03:30:42.000 --> 03:30:52.000
Yeah. Uh, in between, so I'll take a question from Krishna. What is your question? Tell me.

03:30:52.000 --> 03:30:57.000
Yeah, Chris, I think Krishna, right? Krishna Alethi has raised a question.

03:30:57.000 --> 03:30:58.000
Sorry, raise a hand. So, anyone, anyone can go ahead, yeah.

03:30:58.000 --> 03:31:02.000
Sir? Uh, sir?

03:31:02.000 --> 03:31:05.000
Let me stop sharing my screen so that you can share.

03:31:05.000 --> 03:31:06.000
Yeah.

03:31:06.000 --> 03:31:12.000
So, just a minute. Allow, yeah. Now, I think you can share your screen.

03:31:12.000 --> 03:31:20.000
Here's them. For the previous days means before joining this batch, I was trying to learn Langchain by myself for… Yokov and ChatGPT.

03:31:20.000 --> 03:31:22.000
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

03:31:22.000 --> 03:31:33.000
So, I created a chatbot. But I have a few questions related to it. I mean, I was not able to understand this part of the code.

03:31:33.000 --> 03:31:34.000
Okay, so what I did… This… this is the function called get underscore.

03:31:34.000 --> 03:31:39.000
Hmm, which part? Mm-hmm. Gets us an ID, fine, hmm.

03:31:39.000 --> 03:31:45.000
So, here, I have created a… dictionary name, uh, variable name as store.

03:31:45.000 --> 03:31:46.000
Plain. Chadamision History, fine. Got it, got it, dear.

03:31:46.000 --> 03:31:55.000
So, whatever chatting, or whatever the… Yeah, so what… yeah. So my question is, if this is the function call.

03:31:55.000 --> 03:31:56.000
From line number 27, it is going to the line number 20.

03:31:56.000 --> 03:31:58.000
Hmm. Hmm.

03:31:58.000 --> 03:32:03.000
And over here, I'm storing the session ID in the chat message history object.

03:32:03.000 --> 03:32:05.000
Hmm. Hmm.

03:32:05.000 --> 03:32:09.000
But my question is, if this function is returning the store ID.

03:32:09.000 --> 03:32:10.000
Hmm.

03:32:10.000 --> 03:32:22.000
Here, I have not created any variable. So basically, from the control, we'll be going from 27 to 20, and from 23, it will be… coming back to the 27.

03:32:22.000 --> 03:32:27.000
Basically, you will try to call this line number 25, so eventually this is going to call this particular line.

03:32:27.000 --> 03:32:42.000
And automatically, this will call line number 20. So it's not line number 20, focus on the return on line number 23. Always you will be able to get return as a line number 23. Simple.

03:32:42.000 --> 03:32:43.000
We'll be getting… we'll be getting all the time when you will call line number 25. It's a single line, right?

03:32:43.000 --> 03:32:53.000
Okay, but if this line number 23 will be getting in, uh, will be… catching which… Here's it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sir. Mince… America.

03:32:53.000 --> 03:32:54.000
Yes, sir.

03:32:54.000 --> 03:33:03.000
Yeah. Line number 23 means return we'll get. See, that's just a function. From 22 to 23, it's just a function. It will give you single-line return, so whatever return it will give it to you, it will go with the, uh, like, this chain, chain history, CHAIN, chain history that you have written, right? Line number 25.

03:33:03.000 --> 03:33:04.000
It'll go into that one.

03:33:04.000 --> 03:33:10.000
Okay, so that… this particular return will be, uh, storing in chain history.

03:33:10.000 --> 03:33:14.000
Yes, in that object, basically. Session ID object, uh, where you are calling it.

03:33:14.000 --> 03:33:22.000
Okay, but this is the function call. So, basically, in normal programming, whatever, means I have seen.

03:33:22.000 --> 03:33:28.000
Yeah, so basically, you were… you were confused about the bracket, so why we are not using a bracket, why we are not able to pass the input, something like that?

03:33:28.000 --> 03:33:29.000
No, no, sir, no, sir. So, let's take an example. Let's skip this part for now.

03:33:29.000 --> 03:33:33.000
Hmm.

03:33:33.000 --> 03:33:34.000
I'm calling a function, and that function is returning me a multiplication of two numbers.

03:33:34.000 --> 03:33:39.000
Hmm. Hmm.

03:33:39.000 --> 03:33:43.000
Hmm, hmm.

03:33:43.000 --> 03:33:44.000
Hmm, hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

03:33:44.000 --> 03:33:49.000
So, I will be, uh, calling, like, ANS equal to MULT, and two parameters I will be passing. So whatever is been written, it will be stored in… ANS variable.

03:33:49.000 --> 03:33:50.000
Hmm, hmm.

03:33:50.000 --> 03:33:58.000
So over here, if… I am, uh, calling, uh, from line number 27, I am calling the function, uh, getSessionID.

03:33:58.000 --> 03:33:59.000
So, the control should come back to this line, right? Getsession ID.

03:33:59.000 --> 03:34:09.000
Hmm. Hmm.

03:34:09.000 --> 03:34:10.000
Yes.

03:34:10.000 --> 03:34:17.000
It is coming back to that line, basically. It is coming back, so how control will come? In a sequential, manageable execute, right? So, first we will execute chain. Let's suppose… so this is one single object, so all this four things will go together inside our enable with the message history.

03:34:17.000 --> 03:34:19.000
Sir, enable the message history itself is a function, right? You're trying to call.

03:34:19.000 --> 03:34:20.000
Yes, yes. I guess…

03:34:20.000 --> 03:34:39.000
And these are basically an object parameter, means technically you are trying to initialize the… this, uh, like, enable, uh, what is the method? Yeah, run enable, yeah, maybe a class, right? Maybe that is a class, I don't know what you have written, basically. So, basically, the enable with the message history, let's suppose it's a class, we are trying to provide, or we are trying to instantiate it.

03:34:39.000 --> 03:34:44.000
All this four objects, which is an object variable, chain, gets us an ID, input message key, history message key.

03:34:44.000 --> 03:34:45.000
Yes.

03:34:45.000 --> 03:34:50.000
All will go together. Now, out of that, one of these parameters is what? One of these parameters is basically a function. So basically, you have created a class which will take input as a function.

03:34:50.000 --> 03:34:56.000
I think it's…

03:34:56.000 --> 03:34:57.000
Okay.

03:34:57.000 --> 03:35:10.000
But this is what has been implemented over here. Input as a function, so whenever, like, it will try to take that input, it will try to call that function, which execute that function, and what that function is generally doing, it is trying to store your historical message, and whenever you are going to call it in that session, so technically, it is going to return your.

03:35:10.000 --> 03:35:15.000
Historical, whatever, like, a memory that you have saved, right? So it is going to return that from the system ID. This is what it is doing.

03:35:15.000 --> 03:35:19.000
Okay, so… okay, so basically this function is in one line.

03:35:19.000 --> 03:35:28.000
Function or maybe class, I don't know, maybe you can hover your mouse, and then I can check, but yeah, as of now, it looks like.

03:35:28.000 --> 03:35:29.000
Okay.

03:35:29.000 --> 03:35:40.000
Yeah, loading, right? See, it's a class. I told you. And inside this class, clearly it's visible that it is trying to take these inputs, right? So, a getSessionHistory, input message, output message, history message key, history factor configuration, and other…

03:35:40.000 --> 03:35:47.000
Means any kind of a dictionary parameter or key-value kind of parameter, you can try to pass. So this is what it is going to take.

03:35:47.000 --> 03:36:00.000
Okay, okay, sir. Answer, uh, my second question is… means whatever prerequisite for the, uh, deep learning, do we taking that in the classes?

03:36:00.000 --> 03:36:01.000
Uh, no, no, uh, sorry, a prerequisite for the Gen AI.

03:36:01.000 --> 03:36:03.000
Mm-hmm, no. For deep learning, we have a separate deep learning mat, so…

03:36:03.000 --> 03:36:13.000
I'm considering that, don't worry. So, I always, like, I believe in going for basics. So, next class, Saturday, I'm going to talk about the API, and that two API, from a definition, till creation of the API.

03:36:13.000 --> 03:36:14.000
Right? So, I will be using FastAPI.

03:36:14.000 --> 03:36:22.000
So we… we will be using Fast APIs, or…? Okay, so you will be teaching some, uh, background of first AP.

03:36:22.000 --> 03:36:31.000
So, I'll be teaching, like, I'll be teaching how you can create a very simple method, pass the parameter, expose it through the API, test it with the postman, basically.

03:36:31.000 --> 03:36:32.000
Okay.

03:36:32.000 --> 03:36:37.000
Uh, with a post, get delete, and all those operations, and then how you will be able to expose that to the entire world.

03:36:37.000 --> 03:36:46.000
Okay, sir. So, basically, whatever is in this batch, the tech stack will be… become so I will be able to transition my career, right?

03:36:46.000 --> 03:36:48.000
Yes, everyone, eventually.

03:36:48.000 --> 03:36:55.000
Okay, okay. And sir, from when we will be getting, uh, start getting assignments for that?

03:36:55.000 --> 03:37:00.000
Mmm… next Sunday, not even… maybe Saturday, but I'm not sure about it, uh, Sunday.

03:37:00.000 --> 03:37:09.000
Yeah. My assignments are not, like, quite a regular assignment. There are two, three types of assignments I used to create. One that I give into, uh.

03:37:09.000 --> 03:37:13.000
A recorded session, so yeah, that's a proper assignment where I, like, mention the questions.

03:37:13.000 --> 03:37:19.000
Uh, generally in my live batches, I don't give assignment, I give challenges. That, okay, build this, and then discuss inside the group.

03:37:19.000 --> 03:37:20.000
That kind of a challenges. Not like a, solve this question, this question, this question.

03:37:20.000 --> 03:37:24.000
Okay, so we… we will…

03:37:24.000 --> 03:37:29.000
So that I don't follow in my live lecture, that I follow in my recorded one.

03:37:29.000 --> 03:37:30.000
So, as you are the part of Live, so not like a conventional assignment.

03:37:30.000 --> 03:37:34.000
Okay, sir.

03:37:34.000 --> 03:37:40.000
We are going to do it. We are going to, like, build it, and like, like, you are showing your screen, right? If you're not able to understand. So, similarly, people will do that.

03:37:40.000 --> 03:37:42.000
Hmm. Okay, so that will help us to…

03:37:42.000 --> 03:37:53.000
Those things are not a regular basis. That is the only thing which helps a lot of people, and this is something which has helped so many people in the past, as per my experience.

03:37:53.000 --> 03:38:02.000
Okay, so… And so, sir, what is… I'm currently doing, I'm going to ChatGPT, and I'm asking ChatGPT that I'm a 5-year-old kid.

03:38:02.000 --> 03:38:03.000
Don't do, like, I mean, like, that kind of… that level of prompt is not required. I'm a 5-year-old kid.

03:38:03.000 --> 03:38:07.000
And I want to learn Langchen.

03:38:07.000 --> 03:38:08.000
Dad, you're smart enough to understand if you are going to do a follow-ups.

03:38:08.000 --> 03:38:12.000
Means… Okay, so… Okay, sir.

03:38:12.000 --> 03:38:14.000
Okay, fine, the next question, please, uh, from Birdjeet. Go ahead with your question.

03:38:14.000 --> 03:38:19.000
Yeah.

03:38:19.000 --> 03:38:25.000
Special function, yeah, this is our budget. I'm your old student.

03:38:25.000 --> 03:38:26.000
Okay. Mm-hmm.

03:38:26.000 --> 03:38:36.000
2021, iLiver. Okay, so yesterday, I think, uh, two, three days back, I was speaking with you, and I have a group itself. So, with your… after your badge, I'd done the transition in data science.

03:38:36.000 --> 03:38:41.000
Okay, so… so I have done my salary 3X from that time, yeah, in 4 years.

03:38:41.000 --> 03:38:43.000
We'll do it again, 3X, from now on.

03:38:43.000 --> 03:38:50.000
Yeah, so now, uh, so currently, I'm working in investment management company. Okay, so… Where I'm leading the modern implementation team, okay.

03:38:50.000 --> 03:38:56.000
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

03:38:56.000 --> 03:39:07.000
So, looking the modern implementation, deployment, CICD pipeline, and as well as, uh, I'm working as a lead developer as well.

03:39:07.000 --> 03:39:08.000
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

03:39:08.000 --> 03:39:15.000
Okay, so, uh, with an ad previously, I was in Schneider Nettik as a data senior data scientist, okay.

03:39:15.000 --> 03:39:23.000
So, with this, uh, after… after, like, completion of January, or might be one or two years, I'm aiming for.

03:39:23.000 --> 03:39:30.000
Some architect Leban role. So, will it be, uh, justifiable to aim into that way?

03:39:30.000 --> 03:39:31.000
What are your total, total year of experience? Now?

03:39:31.000 --> 03:39:45.000
With my… Uh, totally… see, if I include my BPO experience, it will be around… Total, it will be around 16… 16, 17 years.

03:39:45.000 --> 03:39:46.000
Yes. Nice.

03:39:46.000 --> 03:39:53.000
No, yeah, total, total, yeah, total. And I think, I think you can target. See, BPO, you must have done in your early stage of a career for 2-3 years, or whatever, right? So, no one will even do a BGV for that, don't worry. People do a BGV for, like, last two, three companies, max 2 max.

03:39:53.000 --> 03:39:57.000
And again, so you will be talking about your experience in last 2-3 years that you have done.

03:39:57.000 --> 03:40:18.000
So don't worry about, like, your initial of initial job, yeah. Now, coming to the architecture… architect role. So, uh, the easiest way to correct the architect role, I would say, take your time, maybe for 6 months or 9 months, uh, involve your team, maybe, like, a college colleague, whomever you want.

03:40:18.000 --> 03:40:19.000
Great.

03:40:19.000 --> 03:40:26.000
And then, uh, let's build something. A little bit bigger, right? And then you will be, like, able to, like, switch it again, like, easily. I think this is what we have been following, right, since a very long time, so just do it that.

03:40:26.000 --> 03:40:30.000
And again, I'm here, so I'll be able to help you out.

03:40:30.000 --> 03:40:46.000
Yeah, thank you. Welcome back once again, yep. Thanks. Okay, next one, Amir Arman, we have, Ganesh, we have Krishna Leiti, we have Krishna Pratab, we have Ravi Teja. Anyone can go it, guys, yeah, your wish.

03:40:46.000 --> 03:40:52.000
Yes, any, anyone, anyone?

03:40:52.000 --> 03:40:57.000
Okay, let me mute… all, and then now raise a hand, yeah.

03:40:57.000 --> 03:41:02.000
So…

03:41:02.000 --> 03:41:08.000
Raise your hand, please, uh, because… yeah, Ganesh, please go ahead.

03:41:08.000 --> 03:41:15.000
Yes, sir. So, uh, you will be giving that assignment. That will be challenges in this course.

03:41:15.000 --> 03:41:18.000
So, can we also discuss the solutions? Because the different persons, they will be.

03:41:18.000 --> 03:41:30.000
No, not at all. No, no, not at all, because, uh, we'll see, when I give a project, right, a big, big project, uh, so basically, that I allow to discuss inside the class.

03:41:30.000 --> 03:41:44.000
Uh, REST, when I give a small small challenges, which will start from, let's suppose, like, a next Saturday and Sunday. So, we have a group, and you guys can share your solution over there. Your observation over there, and then you can discuss over there. Everything not need to be discussed, because.

03:41:44.000 --> 03:41:48.000
Anyhow, in my class itself, we are going to write a lot of code, we are going to discuss a lot.

03:41:48.000 --> 03:41:49.000
Right? So everything, because it will unnecessarily consume the time, right? My time, your time.

03:41:49.000 --> 03:41:53.000
Oh, yeah. You know, WhatsApp is good.

03:41:53.000 --> 03:42:07.000
Yes, so the small one, big one, obviously, will invite. So, see, generally what I do is that, whenever I give a big challenge, right, a big project, so let's suppose 3, 4, or 10 people are able to do it, so out of that, we select, like, a 2-3 demos.

03:42:07.000 --> 03:42:10.000
And we just asked them to present it inside the class in live mode.

03:42:10.000 --> 03:42:15.000
So that other people will be able to, you know, ask a cross-question.

03:42:15.000 --> 03:42:16.000
Yeah, sure, thank you.

03:42:16.000 --> 03:42:27.000
But yeah, not for, not for all, everything. So, because I know it's too much, like, time-consuming. Yeah, Krishna Prada, please go ahead.

03:42:27.000 --> 03:42:37.000
Hello, Krishna Padab, I'm available to you. Uh, Pragas, you can go ahead, if I'm audible to you.

03:42:37.000 --> 03:42:42.000
Gohar, you can go ahead. Anyone can go ahead, guys. Please unmute yourself. You all can unmute yourself.

03:42:42.000 --> 03:42:58.000
I'm unable to unmute myself, is it? Okay, Krishna Prattap is saying… Okay, ping me, um… Remove permission. No, no, I think you should be able to unmute yourself. Ask to unmute, let me… okay, click.

03:42:58.000 --> 03:43:00.000
Now, Krishopath, try to unmute yourself, Gohar, try to unmute yourself.

03:43:00.000 --> 03:43:01.000
Hi, is that? Senator Sandley, I completed a Python course from your own.

03:43:01.000 --> 03:43:07.000
Yeah, hi, hi.

03:43:07.000 --> 03:43:08.000
The rate…

03:43:08.000 --> 03:43:17.000
I don't understand the fundamental of AI, or more things, and it is a big problem for me.

03:43:17.000 --> 03:43:21.000
Maybe I am that student who has no knowledge in this class, so what I do now?

03:43:21.000 --> 03:43:26.000
Nothing, just follow along with the class. Yep, have business.

03:43:26.000 --> 03:43:33.000
Simple. Yes? Yeah, thanks. Okay, yeah, next one, Ajit, uh, go ahead, Prakas, go ahead.

03:43:33.000 --> 03:43:35.000
So eventually, yeah. I thought to ask one question, but I forget.

03:43:35.000 --> 03:43:39.000
Yeah, I must, yeah.

03:43:39.000 --> 03:43:48.000
So, currently, we are having, uh, implementing chat assistant, which we are trying to… Uh, get the data source from the SharePoint intranet site.

03:43:48.000 --> 03:43:49.000
Okay, okay.

03:43:49.000 --> 03:43:55.000
So that, initially, with our two put it in the vector DB, and then we try to build a chatter strand on top of that.

03:43:55.000 --> 03:43:56.000
Mm-hmm.

03:43:56.000 --> 03:44:03.000
But there is one new feature we recently done POC, like, there is a co-pilent, uh.

03:44:03.000 --> 03:44:12.000
Studio, where we can just give the. Sharepoint URLs to the Copeland Studio, so that we can able to directly ask that, uh, question to the assistant.

03:44:12.000 --> 03:44:24.000
So, uh… what will be the best, uh, in going for the future, like, uh… Uh, so that's also…

03:44:24.000 --> 03:44:25.000
Yeah, with the chat. Mobility, uh, studio.

03:44:25.000 --> 03:44:37.000
You're saying that, like, going with the RAG, or… No, so if you are using Copilot Studio, if it is working for this solution, then it's fine for now, but let's suppose if I would like to, like, build a complete system where I don't want to use a co-pilot.

03:44:37.000 --> 03:44:41.000
I just want my, like, RAG system to understand my entire document, or whatever is there in a link.

03:44:41.000 --> 03:44:51.000
I can do that as well, there are multiple approaches to solve the same problem, but yeah, if that problem you have solved and it's working, let it be in that way.

03:44:51.000 --> 03:44:57.000
Yep. Yeah. Okay, Ajit, please go ahead. Uh, Krishna Pratap, I think you have raised your hands.

03:44:57.000 --> 03:45:05.000
Since a very long time, but you are not able to ask the question, so please go ahead.

03:45:05.000 --> 03:45:06.000
Yeah. Yeah, you are, you are, actually.

03:45:06.000 --> 03:45:14.000
Uh, hello sir, am I audible? Yeah, so in this course, you'll be, uh… taking any Cloud platforms, like Azure, Google, or… We'll be interacting with them.

03:45:14.000 --> 03:45:17.000
Cloud… cloud-wise AWS, majority of times, I'll be using AWS, and for, like, GPUs, paper space kind of platform.

03:45:17.000 --> 03:45:21.000
Aws, right?

03:45:21.000 --> 03:45:29.000
There is something called a paper space kind of platform, which provides a GPU, and again, there will be a free cloud deployment as well, so Streamlin Cloud Render Cloud.

03:45:29.000 --> 03:45:40.000
For free cloud platform deployment, a basic one. Advanced one, like, where I will be creating, like, an entire end-to-end infrastructure pipeline, that will be AWS.

03:45:40.000 --> 03:45:41.000
Yeah, next question, please. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, go ahead, go ahead.

03:45:41.000 --> 03:45:46.000
Hi, who don't you? How do you do?

03:45:46.000 --> 03:45:51.000
Are we going to again cover the RAG matters, or do we have to…

03:45:51.000 --> 03:45:57.000
In this one, yeah, RAG is there. Syllabus, as a part of syllabus, RAG is there, so I have to cover. Whatever's there in the syllabus.

03:45:57.000 --> 03:45:59.000
Uh, I'll, I'll cover, simple. Mmm, yeah, low glasses, yes.

03:45:59.000 --> 03:46:07.000
So, we are going to cover in the lab class. Okay.

03:46:07.000 --> 03:46:18.000
Okay, so fine everyone, I think we are good. We are able to take all the questions. I can see a couple of people have raised their hand, but yeah, they were not able… they have not asked the question, but that's fine. We are in your connected.

03:46:18.000 --> 03:46:26.000
So with that, thank you so much, everyone. Take care, hope we are aligned, uh, we are able to learn. And again, from next class onwards, agenda is going to be.

03:46:26.000 --> 03:46:36.000
I'll teach you how to create the APIs, then Yuri API will try to experiment a lot, and hopefully, uh, Saturday to Sunday, we will be able to cover that. So, that will be a part of our base building.

03:46:36.000 --> 03:46:41.000
We are not starting the actual lecture, you can say, and again, initial two models.

03:46:41.000 --> 03:46:47.000
Are not actually… actually, this is basically for a base building, so we'll try to spend a couple of, like, days.

03:46:47.000 --> 03:46:58.000
Just to build a base, so that going forward, we should not face any kind of problem. And believe me, by that time, you will get used to a lot of things, uh, which will be required. So, you all will be on the same plane.

03:46:58.000 --> 03:47:04.000
Basically, with that, thank you so much, everyone. Take care, enjoy your entire week. There is no assignment which I have given this week.

03:47:04.000 --> 03:47:09.000
But yeah, you can expect this one in our next one, next week, upcoming week.

03:47:09.000 --> 03:47:13.000
Um, so with that, take care, everyone. Hope you have liked it.

03:47:13.000 --> 03:47:19.000
And, um, yeah, so go and tell your friends and families and everyone. If someone would like to join, let's join.

03:47:19.000 --> 03:47:27.000
At least let them give a try. There's no harm in giving a try in a disciplined manner, and I'm here to, like, uh… talk about everything.

03:47:27.000 --> 03:47:35.000
So with that, thank you so much, everyone. Thank you, Vijaya, Satis, everyone who is Krishnam Padab, everyone, yeah? So, take care, and see you again, guys. We are anyhow connected in a group.

03:47:35.000 --> 03:47:46.000
So, I'm available. Those who are not able to join the group, go and check your dashboard. There is a WhatsApp link which is given. You can join your group, and you can keep on chatting with your entire group member.

03:47:46.000 --> 03:47:52.000
Uh, plus, uh, I'm the part of your group, so… throughout the entire week.

03:47:52.000 --> 03:48:00.000
And yeah, let's do a constructive discussion then, with that. Take care, everyone. Closing the session now. Bye.
