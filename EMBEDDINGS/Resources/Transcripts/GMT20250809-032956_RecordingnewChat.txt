02:10:16	sudhanshu kumar:	Multiplication API with ValidationObjective:Create a FastAPI application that exposes a POST endpoint to multiply two numbers and return the result. Ensure that the input is validated and both a and b should be integers.Instructions:1.	Create a FastAPI application:o	Define a POST endpoint at /multiply to accept two numbers, a and b.o	Validate that both a and b are integers using Pydantic models.2.	Test the API using:o	Postman (send JSON body with a and b).o	curl to test the endpoint with JSON data.o	Python requests for programmatic testing.3.	Bonus: Return an error message if the input values are not integers.
02:10:23	sudhanshu kumar:	Simple Calculator APIObjective:Create a FastAPI application that acts as a simple calculator and exposes endpoints to handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.Instructions:1.	Create a FastAPI application:o	Expose a POST method at /calculator to handle four operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.o	Accept two numbers and an operation type (add, subtract, multiply, divide) as JSON input.o	Return the result of the operation.2.	Test the API using:o	Postman to test the calculator API.o	curl to test each operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).o	Python requests to send requests and receive responses.3.	Bonus: Handle division by zero gracefully and return a custom error message.
02:10:37	sudhanshu kumar:	User Registration APIObjective:Create a FastAPI application that exposes a POST endpoint to register a user. The API should accept a JSON body with a username, email, and password. The application should validate the input, ensuring the email is in the correct format and the password has at least 8 characters.Instructions:1.	Create a FastAPI application:o	Define a POST method at /register to accept the user's username, email, and password in JSON format.o	Use Pydantic validation to ensure the email is a valid email format and the password has a minimum length of 8 characters.o	Return a success message if registration is successful.2.	Test the API using:o	Postman to register a new user.o	curl to test the registration endpoint with valid and invalid data.o	Python requests to test user registration programmatically.3.	Bonus: Store the registered users in memory (for the sake of the assignment) and return the list of registered users when requested.

02:15:59	Sonu Kumar:	sir ,  will you tech flask also?
02:16:16	Shahid Raza:	The command python -m uvicorn test:app --reload runs Uvicorn using Python’s module system, while uvicorn test:app --reload runs Uvicorn directly as an installed command.

Key differences:

python -m uvicorn ... ensures you use the Uvicorn installed in your current Python environment, which can help avoid issues if you have multiple Python versions or environments.
uvicorn ... relies on the uvicorn command being available in your system’s PATH.
Both commands start your FastAPI app, but python -m uvicorn ... is more reliable if you have environment/path issues.
02:16:16	Pundarikaksh Narayan Tripathi:	So I'm sending the error screenshot in the whatsapp group
02:16:21	Md Akhtar:	for post api swagger was running  but it got failed in postman . Is everytime we need to pydantic to run in postman.

03:13:10	Ganesh Sahu:	@app.post("/multiply")def multiply_numbers(model : multiplymodel):        try:            if type(model.a).is_integer and type(model.b).is_integer:                print("inside if")                return multiply(model.a, model.b)            else :                return "invalid input"        except:            print("exception")            return "invalid inouts"
03:14:07	Supreeth Shetty:	Thanks sir dropping off
03:14:26	Shahid Raza:	Where is the multiply method?
03:15:11	Asish Kumar Nayak:	Abhishek, you just save your file and run. I can see you forgot to save the api.py. that's why it gives you "add" is not defined.
03:21:15	Ganesh Sahu:	def multiply(a: int, b:int):    return a*b
03:21:31	Ganesh Sahu:	entire code

    return a*b
