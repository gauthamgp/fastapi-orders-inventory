WEBVTT

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Okay, chat option is disabled, so people are saying in a group… is it… it's not disabled.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Uh, let me check…

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Okay, yeah, yeah, so it is. I'm just changing the settings, so don't worry.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Uh, attendees can chat with everyone. Yeah, so now it's enabled. Now you can chat.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
It's enabled.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Okay, fine guys, so, uh, welcome to class. We are going to start in some time, so it's a first class, so we are not going to talk about anything technical in today's class, so basically, we are going to… talk about, uh, overall structure of the classes, what we are going to do, plus your own ecosystem, and many more things, and then…

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Uh, after this discussion, so I'm going to unmute you. And, uh, where you will be able to ask any kind of a question, and this is the pattern that we are going to follow in each and every classes.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Yeah? So just wait for a couple of more minutes so that all of us can join, and then, uh… I'm going to start my today's lecture, and uh… let me make it live on YouTube as well. Just today's lecture, not from tomorrow, so…

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Let me go live on YouTube. It's been, like, many, many months since… I have not done any live on YouTube, so I think I should do it.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:29.000
General AI Bootcamp, live… Okay. So, go live.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Yeah, so we are even live, um, on YouTube, just for, like, today's class, so… As it's an induction monsoon.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Not fun to model.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Okay, so self-estart, guys. Everyone, yeah, good morning, good morning, Aman Bahava, Mustafa, Amr Indra.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Then we have RCs, we have Vedant, and I believe you all are able to see everyone's message. Uh, so even I can see your message, and I believe message is visible between each and every one. Chad is visible, right?

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And, uh, yeah, so you must be having a raise hand option as well, so we are going to use that option after this live discussion. So, we are… You can raise your hand one by one, I'm going to unmute you, and then you will be able to ask any kind of a question that you have, or whatever question, whatever discussion that you would like to do.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Whatever number of times you would like to do a discussion, we can do it.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Uh, easily. And, uh, you will be having a screen sharing option as well. And, uh, I have an option from my side, so where I can even take control of your screen, and if I have to do anything in your screen.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:13.000
I can do it. So, Zoom provides you all kind of a facilities, so… Where we can try to conduct these entire classes in a very, very interactive manner.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Okay, so Arif, good morning. Sarek, Abhisheikh, Melind, everyone. Good morning, good morning, everyone. Good morning, and welcome to lecture.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Okay, so you start guys, please say yes in a chat, so that we can start.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
So today, it's going to… okay, yes, people are saying yes.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Okay, thanks. So, let's get started. Okay, people who have joined on YouTube, so good morning.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Uh… would it be on YouTube? No, not at all. So it's not going to be on YouTube. Basically, just, like, I have made it live for today, not from tomorrow.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Yep. Okay, everyone, uh, so…

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Let me share my screen.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Hmm, I believe my screen is visible now to all of you.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
So we are ready to start another existing batch, uh, yes?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Obviously. Okay, so first of all, welcome to Elon, guys, and those who are not aware about me, so my name is Sudhansha Kumar. I'm going to be your instructor, I'm going to be your mentor. Now, uh, let me talk about myself a little bit. Those who are not aware about me, for them, obviously, I should introduce myself.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:30.000
So, in total, I'm having 11 years of, uh, 1-1. So, 11 year of, uh, industry experience. So, out of that 11 year, uh, 7 to 8 year in teaching, and approximately 5 to 6 years, I can say, as an entrepreneur.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:46.000
And then before that, so I have started my career with BipRo, and then Deloitte, and then Verizon, and then Ernest & Young, ENY. So that's my career, and since the beginning of my career, so I have been working into multiple technologies, so I have started my career as a Java developer.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And, uh, I was writing a lot of code, and I was doing a lot of things with respect to SAP, so… there are multiple models in SAP.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:15.000
So I was working with that, and then eventually I get into a big data. So, again, where I have used multiple things. Back then, I would say, like, a 7-8 year back, so when, uh, big data or data science was, uh, not as popular as today, so at that point of a time, it was very, very new.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
For all of us, and uh, yeah, so since then, I've started teaching big data and then data science.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:29.000
And then eventually the entire data industry. And obviously, now, it's an age of generative AI, so we are talking about a generative.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Ai. Now, in between, so I have founded a company, so there was a company called as Iron, which has been acquired by Fijixwala, and then, so, almost like an 8-month back.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:53.000
So we have started year-round, uh, with the mentality of creating the entire ecosystem. So, where people will be able to get each and everything in one single place. That was the whole idea.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Behind creating a Euron ecosystem. So. Again, why I'm talking about the ecosystem, or what is the meaning of it? We'll try to discuss all of these things in a step-by-step manner as we are going to progress.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Uh, in today's class, so obviously I'll not be talking about anything technical, so that technical things we are going to start from tomorrow.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Uh, same time, obviously, so… Today, I'm going to talk about just a Euron ecosystem, because in a Euron ecosystem.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:34.000
It's not just our courses. And, uh, obviously, uh, you are going to, like, need multiple things, not just one thing, which is eventually a course.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Courses are definitely, like, will be there, and this is what we are going to discuss.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:45.000
But along with the courses, you need so, so, so, so many different, different kind of things as well. And that is something.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:10:01.000
That we have made available inside a Euron ecosystem. The major thing for this particular badge, if I'll talk about a generative AI badge, just a generative AI badge, right? Let's not talk about any other batches, but let's talk about just a generative AI badge.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:11.000
So, in case of generative AI. It's impossible. I'm not saying that it's difficult, I'm saying that it's practically impossible.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:24.000
To build or to develop anything without access, without having an access of any kind of LLMs. When I say LLMs, large language model. Those who don't understand, it's completely fine. Anyhow, I'm going to give a class on that, a lot of classes.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:39.000
But yeah, so generative AI is not possible at all. Without having an access of an API, or you can say a large language model. Yes, there are a lot of models which is open sourced.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Uh, you can try to download those models, you can try to do an inferencing of those models in your local system.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:11:00.000
But, uh, again, when you go and when you build an application, a real-time application, so at that point of a time, again, something in your local is not going to work, and if you're going to host it on a cloud platform, so obviously it is going to give you a lot of cost.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Now, keeping that in our mind, so this is where this entire Yuri API, which I'll discuss, right? Which I'll discuss, comes into a picture, and what do this Yuri API, how we are going to use it, what and all model I will be able to access, each and everything, we will try to explore, but yes.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:25.000
This is where this ecosystem comes into a picture, and along with this, we have so many different, different things as well. So… One by one, I'll try to start.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:35.000
But, uh… I believe I'm done with my introduction, so if you have any kind of a question for me, just with respect to introduction, so please try to put up inside the chat.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Yeah? Clear guys, everyone, with my intro.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:50.000
So, bring this goes on how things work. Okay, everything will come, don't worry, yeah?

00:11:50.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Okay, so I'm done with my introduction, so now let's get started with this live batch. So what is going to happen in this live batch, how we are going to conduct it? Many of us are already aware about it, but yes, I believe, as an induction session, so we should also talk about this one.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Now, okay, people are saying, please go ahead, fine. So, guys, uh, once you will come inside a Euron platform, uron.1, you will be able to see a live batch section over here, right? A very, like, a second option after home.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Now, once you will come over here, so here you will be able to find out all the live badges. Now, here you can see only two.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
But it's not like there are only two live batches. We have already conducted, I think, more than 14, 15 live batches.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:40.000
So, all those live badges are also available. The previous one, uh, so if someone would like to go ahead with those live batches, they can easily go ahead with those live batches as well. And many people are already, like, going through it.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Now, here, so you will be able to see a generative AI certification, uh, bootcamp.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
This is your batch, by the way, yep? So this is your batch, this is your current batch.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Now, so if you will go inside this one, so this is the start date. Technically, which is today, and we have already started. So, 2nd of August, so this is today.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:12.000
And the best timing is going to be 9 AM ISD to 1PM ISD. So, I have divided this entire batch timing in 2 plus 2 hours, so we're 2 hour.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:21.000
In an uninterrupted manner, I'm going to take my classes, I'm going to deliver my session, so whatever I have to discuss, so I'm going to talk about each and everything.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Yep, each and everything means literally each and everything I'm going to discuss, I'm going to talk about.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:37.000
And then, uh, in the next 2 hours. We are going to take our doubts. Doubts means whatever doubt, because see, whenever we are going to do a practical, right.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:54.000
So many of you will face a problem with respect to our system, with respect to our configuration, with respect to installation, maybe there will be a bug inside our code, and this is pretty much normal. It's very much normal, right? So in every classes, you are going to face some of the issue.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Some of the issue with respect to a system installation, code, bugs, and all those things, and this is where this two-hour doubt clearing session comes into a picture. So generally, in between a class, I take a doubts from a chat.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:17.000
That's the reason, so we have a chat window, right? And after this class, so, uh, just after this 2 hour of this class, so, yes, window will be open, you can raise your hand.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:32.000
So, MEKB, one by one, one by one, so we are going to, you know, uh, take our doubts for everyone. And you will be able to share your screen. Obviously, you will be able to unmute yourself, uh, so not just chat, so chat will be active during a session. So, during our first two hours.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:44.000
And then, next to ours, everything will be open for all of us, and we will be able to discuss. And again, if anyone is having, like, doubts or anything that they have to discuss with respect to a career.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.000
With respect to their resume, with respect to anything, anything is anything. I'm open for anything, I don't have any kind of an issue.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Uh, with respect to, you know, uh, discussion. So, I'm not limiting it just with respect to, uh, technical doubts, or just with respect to a system issue.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:05.000
You can ask whatever comes in your mind, and I'm here to give you the answer.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
That's, uh, one part. On Saturday and Sunday. So, during our live classes.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Now, during, um, like, a live classes, that's completely fine. We will be able to clarify the doubts. Now, what about Monday to Friday?

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Or even on Saturday, Sunday, what about after a class or before a classes?

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Keeping that in our mind, so we have a WhatsApp group, and I believe, and I'm assuming, and I can see now, right? I can see now.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
That I believe all of you are a part of a WhatsApp group.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:51.000
So we have already created a WhatsApp group, and if you will go… those who are not aware about it, so just click on this Continue Learning, and here, in our very first class, this induction class itself, you will be able to find out our resources. I believe my pen is visible and my marking is visible.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:16:03.000
To all of you. So, here, you will be able to see a WhatsApp group link. This is a link for your batch. In every batches, we are providing a different, different WhatsApp group link.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:18.000
So that you will be connected, not just for today or tomorrow, but for a very, very long time, for years and years, uh, with your batchmates, where you will be able to share your thoughts, you will be able to share your findings, you will be able to discuss about any kind of doubts.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:25.000
And eventually, I have seen that, right? Because I'm doing it since a very, very long time, almost like a more than 7 to 8 year now.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Right? So I've seen that, that eventually people helps each other a lot, in terms of getting an opportunity, and not just first one.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Now, I have some of the groups, so where people are, like, uh, people exist since last 7 to 8 years.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
And they have helped each other in 2, 3, 4, 5 transitions as well.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Right? Because, like, everywhere, everyone is working, and at some point of a time, every one of you will be a working professional.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:58.000
So, everyone is trying to help each other, and this is where this WhatsApp group that we have created comes into a picture, and I believe.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Whatsapp is very much handy for all of us. See, I could have created a group on a Telegram, or maybe on a… The slack somewhere, or maybe on a Discord, and many people keep on giving me a suggestion that, let's try to create things there or here, but I believe nothing is more handy than WhatsApp. Even for me, and even for you, for all of us, right?

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:28.000
100% people are on WhatsApp. It doesn't matter… yes, we are, like, we do exist on other platforms as well, but yes, what I believe is, like.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:37.000
100% people are on WhatsApp. So that's the region, so inside this resource group, you will be able to see a WhatsApp link. Click.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Go and join. Uh, don't try to discuss anything which is not suitable or which is not proper.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Inside a WhatsApp group, it's an open group, we are not limiting and we are not restricting you, but, but… Uh, we do take a very, very hard action.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Uh, when someone tried to misuse a platform, or when someone tried to misuse any kind of resources that we are providing.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:23.000
And without any, like, warning, and without asking you anything. Because we know, we know, like, uh, there will be some people, uh, who will try to do some sort of a misadventure. We are living in that kind of world, right? So… Uh, and we don't accommodate those things. So that it should not disturb any one of us in any sense.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:32.000
So we do take those actions as well. So whenever you are trying to do any kind of activity, we are assuming that you are going to.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Do those activities. Uh, by keeping these things in our mind. This is… this is my assumption, but yeah. So, me, my team do take those actions as well.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:52.000
Uh, so that, you know, in a peaceful manner, so we'll be able to, like, you know, conduct, and we will be able to help you each, uh, help you, and you guys will be able to help each other. That's the reason, so we have those, uh, like.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Things. Now. Coming to the next part. So, class timing is fine, right? Batches is fine. Now, you will be able to, like, see this entire thing, even inside an app. So, we have an Android app, and we have an iOS app.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:15.000
So, uh, those who have not downloaded Android and iOS apps, so if you will go down, right, if you will go here.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:27.000
You will be able to see, uh, App Store link and a Play Store link, so you can download it. Now, in the Android app, you will be able to find out even an option to download an in-app video.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Means. So, let's suppose someone is traveling, right? Maybe someone is in a flight, or maybe someone is traveling in a no-network zone, and if you would like to watch a video, so that is possible inside an app, in an offline marin as well, so you can download it, just like any other Netflix or a major or any other application is providing you in-app download.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:58.000
So in the sublur manner, you will be able to see that feature in a mobile device. So, that feature is also available, and yeah, so you can download it inside a tablet, as well as you will be able to download it inside a iPad.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
So all those options are already available, so you can go and you can try to check that out.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Uh, so… how can GenAI help in a testing profile and learning these courses? Guptaji will come to this point, yeah? So, Nurmari.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:20.000
Will open up a live discussion, so there, let's talk about it, yeah? So, let me talk about this entire induction, first of all.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:26.000
And then, uh, I'll be open for all the questions. Whatever question, whatever comes in your mind, right? Just ask it.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
I don't have any kind of issue with any questions. I never hesitate to answer any questions.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000
Yep. Fine, everyone, shall we move ahead?

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Hope, uh, this class is not boring for any all of you.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000
So far, yeah, Amrinda is saying yes, Pius, Prattius, I enjoyed the Kunal logehay.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Can you teach end-to-end project? I'm coming to that point, Navneet, coming to that point, yeah?

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Uh, coming to that one. And don't worry, classes are not going to be boring, I'm not that kind of a mentor.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:04.000
So, you will enjoy it, yeah? Yeah, my lectures are lengthy, so sometimes I used to take a lecture for 3-4 hour, uh, as well, continuously, just a lecture.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Uh, but, uh, again, you will not feel bored, don't worry, yeah? That has never happened in the last 7 to 8 years of my teaching career, at least.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:23.000
So, I don't know Python. We'll come to that point. Yeah. Agenti also covered, it's… like, we have mentioned everything with respect to agency AI.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:32.000
Good to see you after a long time, thank you, like, industrial project. We'll come to that point, uh, project path, Navneeth.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.000
I know you since I long, always enjoy, thank you. Please tell me how to deploy ML model on Streamlit or Hugging Face.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Everything is already mentioned, everything is already mentioned. Are there any fast track of the previous batches? Yeah, those batches are already available, Javith, so… on a plate form.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Fine, 2-hour plus 1 hour question, 2 hour plus 2 hour.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000
I'm not, like, uh, answering all of your questions, I'll be here. Simple.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:06.000
Okay, so… this is about the class timing, guys, right? How long this batch is going to run?

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:12.000
So, I have created a very, very long syllabus, so I'm assuming that, uh.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:34.000
This will go for 4 to 5 months, 3 to 4 months is mentioned over here, but tentatively, it is going to take 4 to 5 months of time, uh, so… Accordingly, you can try to estimate, and that includes a project that includes a resume discussion, that includes everything, right? Everything that I have mentioned inside this entire thing. Now.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:40.000
So let's talk about this particular section, guys, because many people must be having a lot of concern, confusion with respect to this part.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:51.000
Yeah? And I'll come to your question, guys. I know you have a question, a lot of questions, so don't worry. We'll talk about it, yeah? So you can unmute yourself, and then you can ask. I think that'll be very much interactive.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:57.000
But, uh, first I'm going to finish my lecture. And very soon, you will get used to it.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:07.000
I don't do hunt together student-teacher, thank you. Okay. So here, uh, what you will get wise, uh, basically, uh, live class conducted over a Zoom.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:19.000
I think it's happening now. We are on Zoom, right? We are connected. Two-way communication during a live session. I have already mentioned about it. Screen sharing, live dial clearing, already mentioned.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:28.000
Certificate the completion upon finishing up. So, yeah, certificate is even open now, uh, and we are leaving up to you. You can download it.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:36.000
Access to an exclusive WhatsApp group, uh, it's already there. You guys are the part of it. If not, click, and then you can join.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:46.000
Access to Yuri AI app, including a 12-plus model. So when I have launched this batch, at that point over time, it was 12+, now it's become 25+. So now it's not 12, it's a 25.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:58.000
The Zoom AI, I'll be talking about it. Your own job portal, I'll be talking about it. Uh, Python-based module for known coder, and then, like, a career-ready project portfolio, and then one-year access recording of all the live classes.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:09.000
So let's talk about it, uh, one by one. So let's suppose, guys, let's imagine that you are not able to join a live class, right? Maybe this class you are not able to join.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:20.000
And maybe because of any reason, you are traveling, or maybe you are not able to wake up on time, because we have a people who is… who are joining this class from a different, different continent.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Right? So their time zone is different, our time zone is completely different. I'm going to conduct these classes in an IST time zone.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000
And, uh, basically, if someone is joining from some other time zone. So, here.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:43.000
We are going to upload a. A recording of this live classes. So, if you will click on corner, or when you have joined these live classes, you must have heard the voice.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:49.000
That we are recording this one. So this entire class has been recorded, right? So, we are recording this entire session.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.000
And, uh, yeah, so we are going to upload a recording when.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:03.000
In next 2-3 hours, after finishing our live classes, because we are recording this Zoom, and those who are aware about our Zoom.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:13.000
It takes 2-3 hours of time for 3-4 hour long video, yeah? It takes 2-3 hour of time to convert it into a MP4 format.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:28.000
So, after 2-3 hour, we are going to upload this video, not immediately. Immediately is not possible, because Zoom itself takes that much of time to convert your, like, a video to a MP4 format. Mp4 is nothing but the video format that you all will be able to play.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:46.000
So, in, like, a 2-3 hour. It will be available, and where it will be available? Here, inside your dashboard, yeah? Along with the resources. So, whatever resources, whatever code, whatever class material that we are going to discuss. So, along with that, it will be available here.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:56.000
Right? Here, so we are going to create a new section over here with a name of the discussion that we have done on that particular day, and it will be available inside your dashboard.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:04.000
So that, at any point of a time, you can go and then you can try to watch it, and inside an app, you can download it as well.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:10.000
So, you will be able to download all of these videos inside an app, only inside an app.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000
So, that feature is available just inside an app, uh, not inside a biv at all.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000
Yep, so… live class. So this is all about, like, uh, recording?

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Basically. Now…

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:37.000
Coming to, uh, your own ecosystem, yeah? Coming to a Euron ecosystem. So you will be able to see, uh, not just one, uh, option, you will be able to see a multiple option over here.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:46.000
And this is where this Iran ecosystem comes into a picture. Like I said, guys, that when we are trying to learn something, right, something new, something old.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000
So, it's not just one thing which matters for us, it's so many things which matters for all of us.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:27:04.000
Uh, we are trying to learn AI, right? And we all are in an age of AI, where we are using a chat GPT or Gemini, or maybe a CloudA, maybe a Popexity kind of a system, day in, day out.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:10.000
Uh, recently, Poor facility have, uh, like, made an announcement that, you know, India, for all the Airtel user.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000
It's completely free. How long? We don't know, right? At least for one year, it's completely free.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:21.000
But, uh, here, inside a uron, we have our own URI.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:30.000
Right? So, if you are going to click on Yuri. So we are not giving you just an access of a chat GPT, that access is already available to you.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:43.000
Yes, that access is already available to you. You will be able to get an access of a Llama, you will be able to get an access of DeepSeek, Gemini, and seamlessly, you can try to chat. You can say that, that, give me.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:59.000
Uh, 10 code. For Python for loop, right? And you will be able to get an answer, and this is accessible, and this is available to you for an entire year. And this entire.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:06.000
Yuri that I'm talking about, it's as good. Because, see, model-wise, you just need a model access, right?

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:14.000
So, uh, there is no comparison. I would say it's as good as any system that you are going to use out there. Very simple.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:38.000
Right? Very simple, because it's not something that we are using where we have created the model. It's all the branded one that you are using, or maybe you are paying for it. So all of these things are available over here, and seamlessly, you will be able to use it. If I'll talk about a code. So, we have an option, so where, see, this run option. So, you can try to even run it, you can try to even execute those code over here.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:48.000
Even for HTML, CSSC, it is able to execute, right? Then and there, in a chat itself, you will be able to execute, right? All this option that you will be able to find out in any platform.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:57.000
And he means literally any platform, in a free version, in a paid version, right? Everything is available to you for an entire year.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:04.000
You can even do a real-time search. See, we have a web search option, so if I'm going to select this option, I can simply ask.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:17.000
That what is a, uh, like, a temperature in. Temperature in Bangalore. I'm from Bangalore, right? I'm staying in Bangalore, by the way. Uh, India, Bangalore.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:37.000
So I can simply ask that, what is the temperature in Bangalore? And just, I have selected a web search, a real-time web search. So, it is, like, searching all this website, 9 websites, and based on that, it is going to give me the real-time answer, right? So, it is going through. I can ask about the news, or anything in real, I can just try to ask about, and it will be able to give me the answer.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:45.000
I can upload any kind of a document, and I can just ask that, okay, fine, summarize it, or maybe try to give me something about it, or maybe explain it to me.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:53.000
Yes? Like I said. Doesn't matter which chat platform or which AI platform you have been using so far, so forth.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:00.000
Uh, if you are going to use Yuri, it's as good as any platform out there. It's very simple.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000
Right? You will not be able to, like, differentiate that, okay, fine, so this is good or that is bad. No, not at all.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:19.000
If those platforms are good, even this is equally good. And you will be able to get a multi-model access. So, for example, ChatGPT, right? They're going to give you all the model access from a GPD itself. But here, you have a Llama, you have a DeepSeek, you have a Gemini.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:31.000
Right? You have a Gemini, and we keep on updating it, we keep on, like, adding more and more models, select the model, and start chatting, right? Start chatting, as simple as that. I can… even download my chat. I will be able to… so for example, this one, right.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:44.000
I can just click copy link, and then I will be able to share with everyone. So let's suppose I have done some sort of a research, right? So I can simply, like, click over here, I will be able to share, I will be able to download this entire thing as a.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:31:10.000
Pdf, I can copy it. So, everything is available. I can even generate an image, right? So if I'm going to ask that, give me a image of… Uh… Newton, with rows in hand. So, it will be able to generate an image, yeah? It will be able to generate a beautiful image. You can even try to give more and more description, and to generate the thumbnail, and whatever you want, right? You can just do it.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:19.000
So, like I said, it's as good as any system that you are going to use out there, and it is going to work seamlessly 24 by 7.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:27.000
In that way. And, uh, again, so you will be able to use it as long as you have a course access, or as long as you have Euron Plus access.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:38.000
Any limit on the number of image generation? See, we have given you a… Okay, so maybe it is not able to understand while generating the image?

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:47.000
So, basically, it is as good as our… we have given you the enough limit, yeah? We have given you the enough limit, so you will be able to, like, uh, generate it. As simple as that.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:55.000
So this is, uh, Yuri. No. So, Yuri is basically a chat system, and you can try to use it, right?

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Now, Yuri is basically aggregated, or has your own integrated. So, Yuri is basically an aggregator, we have not done any kind of a tweaking. We have basically aggregated platform in such a way that you will be able to access any.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:16.000
International… a world-class model out there. Simple. That's the reason we are saying it's as good as any other system that you will go and use it.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:24.000
Right? So basically, it's an aggregator where we are using some of the proprietary model and some of the open source model as well.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:31.000
And again, at the end of the day, uh, for my student, for my users, so basically, it should solve the problem.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:38.000
Right? It should solve the AI problem, and again, we all are using day-in, day-out AI. So, this is where this Yuri comes into a picture.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:56.000
Now, so I believe Yuri is good, and I believe we all are aware about ChatGPT, so this will not take much time to digest, basically, yeah? And it's an aggregation, so we have not done any kind of a tweaking. So, the way you are using any other platform out there, in the exact similar manner, you will be able to use Yuri.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:04.000
Yep. Now, coming to the second part. So, Yuri is a chat system, then there will be, uh, there is a system called as API. Now.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:11.000
Uh, come to the syllabus. Those who have not looked into a syllabus, just go through a syllabus once.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:26.000
And, uh, again, you can maybe go and ask your friends and colleague about this frameworks that has been mentioned. So, basically, land chain, land graph, Llama indexes, NHN, or maybe, uh, AutoGen Crew AI, right?

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:33.000
Any of these framework, right, any means literally any of this framework that we are going to use.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:40.000
To build an agent. A lot of agents we are going to build, right? A lot of agent-type things we are going to discuss, a lot of fine-tuning we are going to discuss over here.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:47.000
And a lot of tool concept, lot of memory concept, all of these things we are going to discuss.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:54.000
Now, any of… any milk, literally any of these things, you will not be able to learn.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:03.000
If you don't have an access of a LLM, a large language model, technically a GPT, Llama, or deep-sea kind of a Maverick kind of a model.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:15.000
Right? You have to consume an API. Right? You have to look for the API. Now, some people will go to OpenAI, some people will go to Grook, some people will go somewhere else.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:26.000
And then they will obviously try to get those APIs, and again, so every platform is going to give you an API with a limitation. After that limitation. So, obviously, you have to go and pay.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:41.000
Right? You have to go and pay for it. And again, so API-wise, you will not be able to… so those who don't understand API, don't worry, I'll try to explain you those part as well, a technical part of it, how to use it, and what is the API, how does it work. Everything will be explained by me.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:47.000
I'm just trying to give you an overview as of now. This is your day zero, and technically I'm taking an induction, yeah?

00:34:47.000 --> 00:35:04.000
So, any means, literally any system in this entire world, which has been used to build an agent, you will not be able to use it, or whatever things which I have mentioned as a syllabus, if you don't have an API access. And yes, it's not like I'm just providing an API access.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:15.000
There are tons of other vendors, there are tons of other organizations who is providing you API access, but again, as a student, you have to go there, and then you have to basically, like, pay for it once you're.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:22.000
Tier will be over. Right? Now, this is where this Yuri API ecosystem comes into a picture.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:33.000
Where we are giving you a daily 1 lakh token limit. And let's suppose you have an access of 1 year, right? So, technically, it's a 365.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:40.000
Token limit that I'm talking about. 365 lakh token limit per day, 1 lakh token limit.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:52.000
We have built this entire system in such a way that you will be able to keep track of each and everything. Literally each and everything, right? Model status, overview, daily conjunction, token limit.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:36:11.000
And the interesting part is that, that. We are not just providing one single model access. It's a 25, and that from almost all the vendors. So whether it's a chat GPT, which is OpenAI, right? You have GPT 4.1 Nano, GPT 4.1 Mini, text embedding, and that too, with one single API key, you will be able to access all those 25.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Right? Again, those who don't understand API. Um, it's fine.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000
It's my responsibility to make you explain, it's my responsibility to show you that how to use it, right?

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.000
But what I'm trying to say, that you need it. Without that, no one can learn generative AI.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:36.000
No one means literally no one, and no one can build even a single agent, no one will be able to build even a single tool, no one will be able to learn even a single.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:42.000
Framework, I would say, like a Langchain Lama Index, NHN, or any such things, basically.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:56.000
Without LLM access, right? That's a reality. That's the reality, and those who are not aware about it, very soon, you will be able to find out that, yeah? Once we'll progress, once we'll move inside the class. So whether it's a, like, a model from Google.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:03.000
We have all these things, whether it's a model for Facebook, we have that. Whether it's a model from DeepSeek, we have that.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:18.000
Over here. Alibaba, we have that. Mistral, we have that, right? Lgai, we have that. And everything you will be able to access it just with one single API, and it's a very easy-peasy kind of a job, right? To create an API. So just click.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000
Uh, give you any kind of a name, create, and within a fraction of a second, it creates an API for you.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:38.000
It creates an API for you. You will be able to track it, you will be able to see the logs. Logs means, like, let's suppose if you're trying to hit our system, so if it is, like, a… I'm giving you some sort of an error, or maybe a success message, each and everything, you will be able to track.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:55.000
Uh, and I'll explain you. I'll explain the technical part of it, and model-wise, so as of now, we have given you a chat completion API endpoint. We have given you, basically, an embedding generation, which you are going to use a lot during your agent and during your RAG application.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:07.000
We have given an option for speech, TTS, text-to-speech, basically. We have given you an option for a image generation as well. So, we have given an API for all of these.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:15.000
Task, which all of you are going to use it with respect to all the available model. So, one single API key.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.000
All the 25 model axes, you will be able to do. You just have to go and change the model ID.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:31.000
Not just that, right? Not just that. So, we have our own SDK as well. Sdk, those who don't understand, so basically it's a Python, you can say, library, right?

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:41.000
So, if you will go to a PyPi, so, which is a… like, a repository, so where anyone is going to create a Python package.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:39:00.000
So we have launched our Uri AI SDK as well. Software Development Kit as well. So that, with respect to any framework, whether it's a langchain, whether it's a crew AI, whether it's an autogen, whether it's a Llama Index, whether it's a Langraph, whether it's a small agent, whether it's a stream agent, everything in it, and.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:07.000
So, with all of these frameworks seamlessly, just by installing a pip install URI.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:13.000
You will be able to use it. So we have made your life even more easier in terms of.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:26.000
Integration of, uh, entire LLMs. The 25 plus LLMs from a different, different provider, right? With any of this framework. And we have given you a sample code as well. Now, based on that, you can write your thousand line of code, you can build the entire product.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:33.000
Right? So, and again, like, I know for some of us, it's overwhelming on a day zero.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:46.000
I'm just showing you that part, right? Because it's an induction class, it's my responsibility to show you those parts. Anyhow, this is the part of your syllabus, so I'm going to teach you. And when I teach, I start from ground zero.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:53.000
Yeah? So, I'm going to assume that we don't even understand what is the meaning of API. And from that label, I'm going to start my class.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:40:02.000
Yes? So don't worry, it's completely fine. I'm just showing you, and I'm just trying to create a line in your brain that, okay, this is there.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.000
And I'm going to use it. That's the line. That particular line I'm trying to create in your brain.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:22.000
So yeah, all of these things are already available, fine. Now, so, uh… Yuri, we are going to use it a lot, especially in a generative AI classes. Obviously, I'm going to use it a lot, and without this.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:37.000
No one can deliver, uh, classes, technically, right? So, even if you are going to take classes from somewhere else, because there are so many good people out there who is conducting a generative AI classes, but even over there, you need an access, basically. So, you need an access, maybe not from us.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:44.000
From somewhere, uh, someone else. But yes, at the end of the day, you need an access. As simple as that.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:52.000
Uh, okay, so this is, uh, Yuri, uh, API system. Then, coming to this, uh, resume part.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:58.000
Right? Find days, are we going good? Continuously, I'm speaking, I should… I think I should ask.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:07.000
To kindly giveaway, what is it? Don't worry, Anrava, so we'll talk about it, yeah? I'm going to show you practical.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:18.000
Yes, are we good? How much experience we can put into the resume? Don't worry, Asis, we'll talk, yeah?

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:25.000
Okay.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:32.000
Okay, so, best from the best literary. Okay, thank you so much, everyone. Thanks. Okay, so I hope you are going good.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:40.000
Now, uh, so, coming to the next part, uh, from the Euron ecosystem, so we have our Resume AI.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:46.000
So, obviously, guys, uh, when we are going to complete our lectures, when we are going to work on the project.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:54.000
Uh, so obviously, we have to build our resume. Now, project part, let me come to the project part first of all.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:00.000
Uh, so what kind of a project that I have mentioned? So, I'm going to click again on live batches, click here, and come to the last section.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:08.000
Right? Our very last section. Now, here I have already mentioned a project. Now, what kind of a project I have mentioned. So, when I say.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:20.000
That I'm going to discuss, I'm going to talk about the real-world project, I mean it, right? I literally mean it that I'm going to talk about a real-world project. Now, the very first project which you will be able to see.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:33.000
So, Yuri-like chat system, the system that you are able to see, where we are using an open-source model, where we are using a proprietary model, both kind of a model, right, where we are giving you an image generation or a speech, or inferencing with respect to anything, a code compilation.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:48.000
Many things, right? So that kind of a system, we are going to build inside our live classes with our own UI interface, with our own data modeling, with our own database connection, with our own.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:43:09.000
You are URL hosting, so this one. It's not like I'm going to leave you just with respect to a local host, that, okay, execute inside a local. No. So, we are going to deploy it, we are going to host our model on a GPU, we are going to write a logic for our inferencing. Now, many people must not be aware about it. They will say that, okay, you have a model, you can just host it, and then you can do an inferencing, but let me tell you, my dear.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:28.000
Student. Uh, so… Model always gives you, doesn't matter which model you are going to use, model always gives you a raw output. What does this mean? So let me, like, give you a little bit of a glimpse, not much. So, let's suppose you are going to click on this Yuri, right?

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000
Now, if I'm going to ask for that, give me a formula.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:44:00.000
Or give me… Uh, if I'm going to ask, give me… And… explanation of… Sheen rule with… Uh… differential. Now, what I'm trying to show you this example, the reason is very simple. So, see, here you will be able to see a lot of formula and everything, right? Different, different kind of formula and this one.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:16.000
Now, uh, when you take a model, right, when you download a model from a Hugging Face or from any other library, so model never gives you this kind of a formatted output. So we do a lot of, like, write a lot of logic, we do a lot of Latinx over here.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:23.000
Basically, we try to handle each and everything, so whether it's a formula, whether it's a table, whether it's an output.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:29.000
And it leads a lot of edge case to be handled.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:38.000
It's not like you will just download the model and you will be able to build this kind of a system. So, this is where this system gets even, like, more powerful. Plus, in a real time, it should answer your query.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:52.000
Right? In a real time, and not just for one user. So I'm using it, and even you are using it parallelly, right? So it should work for a thousand thousands of users at a time. It should work with respect to a web search, it should work with respect to a code interpreter. You can… you should be able to, like, you know.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:45:10.000
Upload your voice, so that is a kind of a project I have mentioned over here, and that too, till deployment means till a real deployment, right? Not just a streamlined kind of a deployment on a streamlined cloud. Yeah, those kind of projects also we do, right, in many batches, plus even during a live classes, I'm going to show you.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:18.000
But those are an easy one. Those are just a one-step kind of a deployment, which eventually you all will be able to learn in no time.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:25.000
So, this kind of a system we are going to discuss, then AI internship and job portal recommendation, kind of a system, AI meeting summarizer.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:36.000
So, this is one of the biggest ones. It will take a time, but it's a big, big, literally a big system. Until URL hosting, right? We are going to talk about.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:45.000
This particular project. So, if you will be interested, you can buy your own URL, you can try to host it on your own URL by creating that particular product.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:52.000
And, uh, again, the entire infrastructure on scale. So that is something which I'm going to teach you.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:46:02.000
And, uh, why I'm able to teach you, the reason is very simple. So, there is something that we have built it internally. So, obviously, we have our own codebase, and we have, like, everything.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:14.000
We can, we can teach easily. So here we are using OpenAI UI, and we have another version of Yuri, which we have been using right before, uh, like, this particular month.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:24.000
And, uh, where even our UI interface, our entire inferencing and everything is, like, written by us. So here, we have implemented our OpenWeb UI, which is one of the smoothest one. Those who are not aware about it.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000
You will get to know, eventually, yes? But yeah, we are going to teach you everything.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:39.000
And that one. Uh, that will be a time-taking project. So, that is basically a project. Now, let's suppose if you're able to do a project, classes in each and every thing. So, obviously, you will be looking for an opportunity, right?

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:45.000
This is where this Resume AI comes into a picture, because you have to create a resume in a very first place, right?

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:54.000
You have to go and create a resume, and maybe you are a fresher, maybe you are an experienced person, maybe you have a good, bad, any kind of a resume, possible, right?

00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:01.000
So, here we have given you an option. So, initially, you will see two options, but technically, there are three options over here.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:12.000
So, you can try to revamp your existing resume, and uh… let's suppose I have a bad resume, so I can just try to click on revamp resume, I can select 3 templates, 3 formats we have given to you.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:22.000
So, you can select any of these formats, and then you can try to upload your resume. So let's suppose I have a bad mint, literally, very, very bad. This is one of the baddest resumes.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:27.000
Um, as you can see, night, very bad resumer, right? There is no formatting, nothing.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:39.000
Just try to open it up, dump it, put your GitHub URL, put your LinkedIn URL, otherwise keep it. You can try to put up your job description as well, so that according to job description, it is going to align.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:45.000
And then escape this step, so… now, it will start creating your resume, it will give you a guidance with respect to your interview preparation.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:54.000
It will tell you even an ATS score. Why ATS score matters? Ats means Applicant Tracking System.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:06.000
So nowadays, whenever you are going to apply. In any company, right? In any company. So, basically, uh, uh, your resume will not be reviewed by a human first.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:16.000
You… there is a machine, someone has written the logic, and machine is trying to evaluate your entire things. I mean, technically, code is trying to evaluate your resume.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:24.000
Right? And the ATS applicant track, that is something called as applicant tracking system, ATS, which everyone.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:36.000
Everyone means literally everyone is using it. In our current situation, right? Because whenever someone tried to publish a job, so obviously there will be thousands of applicants, no one is having time to go through it.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:46.000
And, uh, ATS system always tried to map, uh. Keywords which is available inside a job description versus your resume.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:52.000
And this is where this entire system, our resume system, comes into a picture, which is going to help you out.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:58.000
Right? Which is going to help you out in terms of improving your ATS score.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:03.000
And then it is going to enhance your resume. So see, I have uploaded a bad, bad resume, right?

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000
And as such as the format, now I see there is Gmail.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:11.000
So, let me, let me open up that resumer once again.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:30.000
Oh, my zoom in…

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:35.000
So this was the original one, right? This was the original one, and as you can see, it's a very, very bad one.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:40.000
Right, a very bad one, unstructured one, and a scattered one, I would say.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:45.000
And, uh, this is something that system is able to create in 2-3 minutes of time only, right?

00:49:45.000 --> 00:50:03.000
And in a complete structured format, formatted way. And we have given you 3 templates. Not just that, so it is going to generate even a cover letter for you, so you can generate your cover letter, right? So automatically it is going to put up each and everything, and in a structured manner, it is going to generate the cover letter, because again, cover letter will be required for some of the company, or maybe.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:19.000
If you are going to apply for maybe a master's or PhD. Apart from that, so it is going to give you some hint as well. As per your resume, that, okay, fine, so if you're going for an interview, then what kind of expectation you should have with respect to managerial round, general question, HR question, uh, behavioral question, and technical question, if your resume is technical.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:25.000
Basically, it works for everyone. It works for even a lawyer, accountant, everyone, basically, right?

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:34.000
So if you are technical, then only it is going to populate that technical question and everything. Uh, those who would like to create a resume from their scratch, they can do that as well. Click.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:44.000
Fill all the details, so select any of these templates, and one by one, fill all the details. Right. And it will be able to create. So, in either way, if you're creating a fresh resume, or from the existing resume.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:51.000
It works, basically. So this is where this Resume AI comes into a picture, and I believe all of us are going to use it.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:57.000
By default. It's a need of an R. Obviously, you need it, and you are going to use it.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:16.000
Yeah, so the Zoom AI. Fine, guys, please add more template also. I think 3 is fine, uh, Avina. See, more means we can add 100, but doesn't make sense, right? It will end up confusing a people that which one I'm supposed to choose. So I think 3 is a fair enough, I would say.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:20.000
How much score is good? Uh, anything above 80 is good.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:48.000
You can say anything above 80 is good. This was so good getting expected questions section. Yeah, so the resume one, right? Yes, obviously. So this, this never gives you a detailed question, we have not configured in that way. We have configured it in such a way that it will give you a glimpse. The reason was, again, very simple, because, see, we have a Yuri ecosystem, right? You can upload your entire resume even over here, right? And then you can say that, okay, fine, so give me a preparation, or give me a 200 question, give me a 500.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:52:03.000
Question. So, we have, we already have a Yuri ecosystem. So, here you can just upload your revamped resume and then ask for, like, a preparation. It will give you a question, it will give you an answer, so even with Yuri, you will be able to do all the preparations. So keeping that in our mind, we are just giving you a glimpse so that.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:11.000
Uh, it will open up your mind. It will open up your aura, basically, that, okay, this is something which can be asked in this area.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:19.000
So I think I should focus on that part. So that's the reason, so this is a sample one. I'm even not saying that it's a detailed one, not at all. And intentionally, it's been done.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:26.000
Intentionally, because we have a Yuri, right? So, you can go ahead and generate 500 or maybe 1000 questions.

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:46.000
Uh, I'm not going to sell Euron in a coming year, right? Uh, Sib, uh… That's a… that's a tough question, by the way. So those who are not aware about my, like, background, so, basically, there was a company called asynidron, and which has been acquired.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:53:00.000
Everyone, entrepreneur's dream, you can say? So… Uh, not so soon, because, see, even I was a part of Inirun, which I had founded in 2019, for, like, a straight 5 years, five, five and a half year.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:07.000
And, uh, there was a lot of translation. A lot means lot of transition. More than, like, 10,000. I think 10,000 is a small number.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:15.000
And there was, like, a 1.5 million total students, and we have started teaching in a affordable manner in Iran.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:26.000
Uh, uh, when there was no one in a market in that affordable section. So, yes, there was a lot of edotech company, which was charging, like, a 1 lakh rupees, 2 lakh rupees, 3 lakh rupees.

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:33.000
So, we have started in that way. And yeah, that became popular because of you guys.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:39.000
Because, you see, it's all about the student, right? So, Audutec is basically a service industry, which I think.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:52.000
As part of my experience. And, uh, here, nothing matters, I would say, except only one thing. So, just take care of a student, help them out in terms of making a transition, or their end goal, whatever your end goal is.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:56.000
And then, uh, your company will flourish. So, we did that. That's in our DNA.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:15.000
And, uh, yeah, so again, with Euron. Uh, because, see, before Intrapreneur, I was a teacher. I was a techie, I was a teacher, and then I have started, then I have started a company, uh, eventually. Uh, so… That's a region somewhere, like, uh, you know, I feel that that… I felt, basically. I was like a…

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:22.000
Blank for so many days. I was not doing anything, and then I decided that, okay, fine, so I think I should go and I should do a teaching.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:35.000
Uh, again, uh, so that's the reason I have started Euron. Because… By heart, so I'm a teacher. I just love taking classes and, like, doing a discussion with the people out there.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:51.000
Right? Uh, whether it's a tech things or whether it's a, uh… entrepreneurship, or anything, anything, right? Uh, so that's the reason we have a Euron. I don't know what will happen in the future, at least after 5 years, but yes, till 5 years, so obviously, I'm here.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:57.000
I'm teaching. As a teacher, I can say, right? So, I'm going to teach.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:13.000
Okay, so we have a resume AI, I think I have discussed about it, yeah? Now we have a job portal as well. Now, job… there are so many job systems out there, right? There is LinkedIn, there's Nokri, there is Indeed, there is HiRisk, there is Monster, there is TimeJob, so many job portal, right?

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:18.000
Out there. And, uh, there are so many companies' career pages as well.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:31.000
Yeah? So, every company will be having their own career page, just give a name of any company, maybe it's a… JP Morgan, it's a Google, Facebook, or anyone, right? Tcs enforces BPro, everyone will be having their own career pages, yeah?

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:39.000
No, so it's very tough to navigate through all of those career pages one by one, one by one, one by one.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:45.000
And, uh, you know, go and apply for that job. So, here, again, we are behaving like an aggregator.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:58.000
So, for my student, I thought that, that, okay, uh, what, what if we can try to bring all of these jobs for the entire world? Not just a technical job. So, we are bringing almost every kind of a job, so even you can search for a lawyer.

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:09.000
Even you can search for accountant, you will be able to see the job, and then you can try to enter the location. And we are trying to bring more and more. So, as of now, for some of these filters, maybe for an internship and remote, it will not work.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:18.000
But it will start working very soon. So we are trying to bring those jobs as well. So, what this platform does, let me tell you, like, things, uh, like, clearly over here.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:28.000
So, we are not a job creator. Right? So, whatever job that you see on those hundreds of different, different platforms, right, and you have to go through it.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:39.000
We are… so even from a company's job, like, site, basically, right? So, we are trying to bring all of those jobs, we are trying to behave like an aggregator over here.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:46.000
So where everything you will be able to find out in one single unified platform. For example, if I'm going to search for machine learning, right?

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:56.000
So, here, it will, uh, like, try to fetch a machine learning job for me, as you can see, right? Uh, as you can see, so from multiple companies, it is able to fetch a job in no time.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:04.000
Yeah? No time. You can even check your location, so whether you are from a USA, you are from UK, you are from an African continent, you are from a Middle East.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:13.000
It is going to work. Simple. Right? It is going to work. And not just for tech, I said. Like I said, right? So, it is going to work, basically, for any kind of a keyword.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:28.000
Uh, you are going to ask and filter. Uh, we are trying to bring more and more. We are trying to work more on that internship job side. It does your opportunity side, and then, uh, more and more jobs for a fresher side. So, we are working a lot. Our team is… because.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:44.000
Again, those jobs are, like, scattered on millions of different, different platforms across a different region, country, and continent, right? So it's tough, but yeah, so we are, like, building it, and even now, the system works, you know, super, super perfect manner.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:54.000
Where you can go, you can try to search for the job. And this is just a part of your own ecosystem. We are trying to make it even better and better and better, but even now, it's good, yeah? You will be able to search it.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:57.000
So that my students are not supposed to go, you know.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:09.000
On those N number of platforms, and then apply. You can go, obviously, like, uh, but I'm not saying that you should not go. You should go everywhere, wherever you can get a job, but yeah, so even inside auron, you have that particular option.

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:13.000
So, this is all about a job system. Hope this makes sense.

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:25.000
Now, uh, then there is an internship portal. So, see, guys, um… Uh, basically, you're trying to learn something new, right? You're trying to learn something new.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:29.000
And, uh. There is nothing called as learning, by the way.

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:36.000
So, uh, especially on a tech side, because you are not trying to learn, uh, so that you have to clear some exams.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:44.000
Like, UPSC NEAT or ITJE. No, not at all. Yes, so in case of ITG, in case of need, in case of UPSC.

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:48.000
We have to crack exam, right? We have to go and write a paper.

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:53.000
Uh, but, uh… You are trying to do a tech upskilling.

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:59.000
Or maybe a reskilling, right? Now, so here you are not going to give an exam.

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:06.000
You are going to give an interview. You are technically preparing for the interview, and inside an interview, people are going to talk about your experience.

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:14.000
People are trying… people will try to talk about her skills. People are going to talk about, basically, like, the things that you have built, or maybe you are building.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:23.000
Right? So, a real skill matters, a real project matters, a real thing that you have built is going to matter.

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:27.000
And it matters, literally, a lot. Lot means literally a lot.

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:35.000
So, keeping that in our mind, so we have created an internship portal, so where you will be able to find out, uh, 700 projects, not just one.

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:54.000
700 project, yeah? We have uploaded so far, and we have even given you an option to request a project so that my team can review your requirement. Let's suppose you are saying that, okay, so in this domain, you should put a project with this theme. So, we have given you this request, a project option as well. So, where you can request.

00:59:54.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Uh, this request will not be fulfilled immediately. It takes time, uh, but yeah, so team is going to look into it, and then they are going to dump a project over here. Now, we have created this internship portal in such a way that you can come over here, and you can try to search.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:17.000
For the project, maybe, like, a generative AI. As we are going through generative AI, right? So I can try to search for maybe a generative AI, right?

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:33.000
So I can search for agility. Ai over here, and I will be able to see a lot of projects. A lot of projects, I will be able to see from a different, different domain, as you can see, right? So, and I can click on this view details, and here.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:39.000
In every project, it's the same. Uh, same means, uh, this, uh, theme is same, right? Project will be different.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:55.000
So, here we have mentioned a PRD, project requirement document. You can open it up. Hld, High Label Design Document, LLD, low-label Design Document. So, all of these things we have given to you, the way you will be able to see a project in any industry.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Right? In any industry, because if you're going to join a team, so obviously there'll be a PRD, your team lead, or… Someone is going to discuss that with you, and then there will be a requirement which will be mentioned, there will be a feature or enhancement that will be mentioned, and uh… in the exact similar manner. So, keeping that in a mind.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:20.000
And just to bring you closer and very, very closer, uh, towards our industrial approach of developing anything.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.000
These document HLD, LLD, and PRD is given to you inside a.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:39.000
System itself, for every project, right? So that you can go through it, you can try to understand it. We have given you that what you have to build, so we have even given you a technology stack everywhere, so that you can try to start building those systems.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:46.000
And then you can submit it, right? Plus, for that, so let's suppose if I'm going to click on enroll now.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:53.000
So, you will be able to, right? So, let's suppose I have enrolled into one of the projects, right? I have enrolled into one of the projects.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:02:03.000
So, you will be able to get an internship offer later. So, when you are going to join. So, this is the intensive oscillator. I have generated just now, right? So, first.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Uh, yeah. So, you will be able to see a intensive oscillator. Anyone can come in, anyone can click and even verify if you are going to submit your return operator somewhere, right?

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:19.000
And everything is mentioned very clearly, that how this internship is going to happen, and what we do, everything, everything in a very, very clear manner.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:30.000
And you can start your internship. So that is just an offer letter, by the way, right? Not a completion. Completion, you will be able to get once you are going to complete it. So technically, we give you two letters. One is a.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Joining, onboarding, and then another one is basically at the time of completion. And in between, so we have given you this Kanban board as well, so you can create tasks, basically, like, uh, for you. You can try to keep track of those tasks. So, this is, again, the kind of a board we have already given to you, so… Amazing one, see? I'm able to, like, float it from, like, a 2-2 in progress to finish, right?

01:02:53.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Plus, let's suppose if you would like to do this project, not alone, right? Not alone, you would like to invite someone.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:15.000
So, we have given you that option. So, here, you will be able to see your team member, and here, you will be able to see an invite member. So, you can try to, like, if you're going to click on this invite member, so link will be copied automatically, now you can share that link with anyone.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.000
And if that person is also a part of Euron. If not, it will not be allowed.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:28.000
If that person will also be a part of your own, you can, uh, like, that person can join your project. But yes, you will be a lead.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Yeah, you will be a lead. So, first come first. That person can join some other project as well, and you can start any number of projects over here.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Now, we have given you this internship portal, uh, not just for a fresher or dropout.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:49.000
But for everyone. Reason is very simple. I know that if you're a working professional, you don't need an internship. I completely agree, right?

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:54.000
I completely agree. But let's suppose if you're trying to do a transition from one technology to another technology.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.000
So obviously, we are going to talk about a project in a class.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.000
But even you should try building some project on your own.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Right? And the biggest problem that I've seen people face is that they don't know what to build.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Right? See, there are, like, millions of things to build in this world, right?

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Yeah, people are building it. But somewhere we all get confused. We are not able to see the direction, that, okay, fine, so what project I should do, what things I should build.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Here is an option, which is given to you. Right? With the ultimate, detailed way. So, each and everything is given to you.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:43.000
So you can come over here, you can try to build, you can try to maintain your GitHub repository, and eventually that will give you the experience. This is what I want. And obviously, for a fresher, or anyone who is in a third year, second year, fourth year.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Uh, they're doing their undergraduation, undergraduate, or whatever, right? Uh, master's.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:55.000
So, obviously, you need a later. You need, uh, internship, right?

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:01.000
So, here we have given to you. And again, so it's easy to get an offer letter, but believe me.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Uh, you will not be able to get a completion letter unless and until you are not completing it as per the guidelines.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Very simple, right? So, offer later, go ahead, generate hundreds of offer later, no issue at all. Completion later will not give you, or system will not give you, technically.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Right? Unless and until you are not fulfilling the complete requirement of a project.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Very, very simple. Straightforward. Yes? How about data setup for the project? So, data set you can generate, right? So, dataset C, whenever we try to do an MBPs or POCs kind of a thing.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:42.000
So, obviously, uh, we try to, like, mock up the data.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:47.000
You have an AI, right? You have a UCI repository, you have a Google data set, you have a Hugging Face data set.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:52.000
So, you can just go ahead and just try to, like, get a dataset from there.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:06:05.000
This is all… so, hope I have answered. Only for Indonesia, yeah, whatever we build, we build for our Euron user. Uh, reason is very simple. See, this is not a very first time when I'm into an entrepreneurship journey. So, I have seen that, that, uh.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:12.000
When you give an excessive leverage to the people, right, so there will be some people who will try to exploit the system. So, keeping that in our mind.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Uh, I just wanted to cater my students, my, uh, Euron users.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Right? In a best possible way, right? Without any kind of a distraction. So, that was the… it. We can use Kegel for dataset. You can use Kegel for dataset, use CIE for the dataset, Google dataset, you can try to use a Hugging Face dataset, because in every project, you need a different, different kind of a dataset, right? Because theme is different, requirements are completely different with respect to the data set, right? So… you can just go ahead, or you can even ask AI to mock up the data.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Right? I'll create maybe thousands of records for that. Mentorship will be provided for the project? No. In internship, we expect you to do the project. We don't give a mentorship for an internship, right? We never, we never give an internship, because we have given an AI system, we are teaching you, so we are not selling an internship, right? So basically, internship is a part, internship is one of the features.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:11.000
That we have given to you, and uh… you have a group, that's the reason we have a group, so go ahead, do a discussion, try to onboard someone, because we are anyhow teaching you a project.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000
It's not just one, it's hundreds of projects which is already available on our platform.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Right? So, it doesn't make a sense to, you know, teach you and guide you and, like, in an internship again.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:30.000
For that, we have a classes. For that, we have a courses. We are already doing it, right? And you have access of it.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Right? Uh, so… And plus, we have our groups. So, this is how it is going to happen. Honestly speaking, mentorship, I don't, like, uh… think that it's required, basically, because obviously you will be able to get that label on your own.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:56.000
And, uh, yeah, so I'm open for any discussion, in a group or even inside this, uh, live classes, so… I'm not saying that I'll not answer your question.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000
But yeah, dedicatedly for a particular project, there is no mentorship.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Because that is already… that will be discussed in the courses. Hope it makes sense.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Okay, so intensive is done, API is done, UD is done, resume AI is done, job is done. Uh, there is a very small feature called as Focus Mode.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Uh, because I know that we are living in a… era of Instagram and Facebook, where it's very hard to resist.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Even for a single minute. Uh, without switching a screen, right? Or without looking at my, uh, at your mobile. It's literally very difficult. So much of distraction, right? So, this is… this was just a fun project for my development team. Uh, so they said that, okay, fine, so let's try to, you know, create something like that. So they have just created this for you.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Uh, where if you are feeling distracted, so you can put up the timer, you can try to select the theme, anything that you want. A lot of themes is there, you can try to even, like, see the strats, that how much focus you are able to do. So this is just a small app that we have given to you. Not a big one.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:12.000
But yeah, so… to, like, create the focus, right? Create the focus, by the way. So… This is one of the… feature. And, uh, this combines the Euron ecosystem.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Uh, there are a lot, there are a lot, so there are a lot of, like, courses you will be able to find out. We are even working on the books.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Uh, we don't have much of books as of now, but yeah, so in our future, uh, for example, uh, so we have, like, books for, uh, DSA.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Uh, so I can, I can just click over here, I can go over here, and then I can try to read out the.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Complete, books, it's loading. It's a big one, yeah. So you will be able to, like, see the books over here.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Uh, you will be able to go bookmark, read out. So we are, we are trying to create such kind of books as well, so that my students are not supposed to go and do the investment once again. But yeah.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:59.000
As of now, it's a limited one, because it takes time for us to even write these kind of books and to create it.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Uh, with the limited resources that we have, plus we have given you the AI summarization for the entire book and for the particular pages, plus we have given you the highlight option. In a mobile, if you are going to open it up, so you will be able to see that, uh.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Flipbook kind of options. So, that feature is also available. So this is… I'm discussing just on a side note. So, we have a book feature as well, and uh… some of the good books we have already uploaded.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Uh, but still, we are working more and more on this. So maybe in next couple of months, I would say, not immediately, you will be having some books.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Uh, plus, apart from that, so, a last-to-last month itself, two-month or two and a half month back, so I have launched this roadmap.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:53.000
So how this roadmap works, actually? So basically, we have created you this, uh, amazing roadmap kind of a structure, so let's suppose if someone is going through an AI, from a beginning itself. So, course is already mapped, and these courses, I'm trying to create fresh.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:11:07.000
We already had our courses, actually. We already had our courses, we have already given a lot of, like, live classes, we had a lot of self-class courses, but I had a dream of recording almost all the tech.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Uh, by my own, so that is something that I had as a dream since last, like, 2-3 year.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Somewhere I was not able to get time for it, uh, so this time I have decided that, okay, I'll do it, this time I'll do it now.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:38.000
So I have already started doing it. It's running a little bit late, uh, so maybe you are aware about it. If you're new, so maybe you're not aware about it, but yeah. So personally, I'm doing a recording. Some of the courses I have already finished.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Most of the courses are under progress, and like I said, so it was my dream to do a recording, so I'm just trying to, like, fulfill my dream by working on these, uh.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Like a hybrid project, so I have named that as a hybrid, basically. So, hybrid project, but it's getting delayed a little bit.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Hopefully, I will be able to, like, you know, cover those delays very soon. So, I'm working, still working on that.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:10.000
So that you will be able to access all of these courses along with the project, discussions, each and everything.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Anytime. Anytime means, in a selfish mode, anytime. So, again, that is a part of the Euron.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Uh, plus ecosystem. And plus, with respect to this, uh, you know, amazing roadmap, you all will be able to see it. So whether it's a.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.000
So, I have created, I think, 7 to 8 roadmaps. Uh, in future.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:35.000
There will be more, which will come. So, as I will, like, get time, I will get some bandwidth.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:43.000
I'll just do it. So, I have a lot of plan with that, but yeah, that will come in the future. As of now, I'm anyhow running late for this one.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Uh, because of my schedule and, uh, timelines, uh, basically. Yeah.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:13:07.000
So, that is it, guys. As a part of your induction session. That's it about this entire Euron ecosystem. Hope all of us are able to understand, hope all of us are able to know that what is what.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:11.000
And where you can go and where you can try to find out, uh, what.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Uh, so, just an introduction. So, anyhow, we will be the user of it, right? So, we are going to use it day in, day out.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:28.000
And, uh, not just, uh, like, uh, we have not built a system where you will just come and learn. No, a lot of things, lot of things, right? A lot of things. That's the reason we say that as a urine ecosystem. And that, too.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:37.000
The intention is to maintain the affordability. Affordability means, obviously, going forward as we are going to increase the courses, as we are going to increase the offerings.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:47.000
We may increase the prices in future, so… That will come, because it is costing us, right, it is costing us.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:55.000
But, yeah, so still, we will be affordable, as simple as that. Means, uh, we'll be in a limited range, so even if we are going to increase.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Now, future, it will not be, like, a too high. That anyone and everyone can't afford.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:07.000
As simple as that. Wanted to know about a vibe coding, at what depth it will be taught.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:12.000
But I'll teach you why I'm coding, don't worry. I have already mentioned it as a part of your syllabus.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:34.000
So… and I do a lot of whiteboarding. Again, uh, so Amravai is saying, so what is the tenure of this current Gen AI course? It's a 4-5 month under Rava, which it is going to take. Do you think that today's, uh, time deal concepts are… for generative AI, see? Guys, again, many people ask me this question, that I'm trying to learn a generative AI, right?

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:41.000
So, does NLP required? Does deep learning require? Does a stats concept required.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:48.000
See, I'll say it is required and it's not required. Both. I'm not saying yes, I'm not saying even no.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:53.000
I'll give you the reason for that. So, here, this generative AI batch.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Uh, which I'm talking about, right? I have mentioned a lot of concepts. For example, right, for example, let's talk about this concept itself.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Embedding concept. So, where I'm going to teach you that how you will be able to use all of these vector databases, how you can try to use a URI API, how you will be able to convert your data into an embedding, which is nothing but a vector space.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:31.000
And then store it, and then retrieve it, and then do all kind of an operation with respect to the embedding. Now, obviously, to understand the embedding, you have to understand a similarity search, like a cosine similarity, you have to understand maybe a Manhattan distance, you have to understand maybe a Euclidean distance concept, you have to understand.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:36.000
So we are, again, mathematics, a little bit of equation, and mathematics comes into a picture, right?

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:42.000
So, when I'm going to teach you this particular section, so obviously, I'm going to teach you even those things.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Which is a prerequisite for this one, this particular section. And same for next, same for next, and same for next.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Right? So, in this manner, what is required, right. Anyhow, that will come into a picture. If it is a concept coming from a deep learning section, if it is a concept coming from an NLP section.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:06.000
That will be discussed, right? Because I know that without a base.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:14.000
You will not be able to remember, and you will not be able to correlate, and going forward, you will not be able to explain the same thing.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:24.000
To someone. To someone means your interviewer or maybe your team leader, someone, right? So I do understand that particular part. So I'm going to move inside a class.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:30.000
With that philosophy. Hope it makes sense, right? And that's the reason I said it's important, it's not important.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Right? So if you are going through this entire roadmap, so I have already created a generative AI roadmap as well, let me show you.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:51.000
So, generative AI. Automap, right? If you'll go through my roadmap, again, this is something which I have created. I have clearly mentioned that you should go through the Python, then go through the stats, then go through the NLP, then go through the generative AI, then go through the RAG, then go through the MCP, then go through the LLM ops, right?

01:16:51.000 --> 01:17:04.000
I have mentioned that part, right? So, I'm aware that somewhere you need a consort of NLP, somewhere you have to understand the transformer, its architecture, its whole algorithms, its calculation, right? I do agree, I do understand each and everything.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Now, I'm the one who have created this particular roadmap as well, where I'm clearly saying that, okay, you need Python, you need stats, you need NLP, you need… because here, someone is going on their own.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Right? Now, in this class, when I talk about a live batches, I'm teaching it, right? I'm teaching you directly.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:28.000
So, over there, section by section, as we are going to move, whatever will be the prerequisite, I'll discuss first.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:38.000
So, I'm able to answer your question that with a deep learning, NLP, all those things are required or not, and yeah, many people were asking this question, even in a group, and when I've started this batch, so Mimira was talking about it.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:54.000
So, now I'm able to clarify. Are you going to be surprised for the existing software? No, see, for existing, we'd never change anything. So, uh, like, uh, even previous price of your own plus was, like, uh… different, it was less… recently, we have increased a little bit, right? Very little we have increased.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Uh, so, uh, those who are having an access, uh, they have an access now. Yeah, for next year, if you're going to upgrade it, because we all have an access for one year, so you have to, like, go ahead with the revised one.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:19.000
But for the existing one, we, like… means if you have taken once, it's, like, for a year, nothing is changing for you, doesn't matter how many things we are going to bring on a platform. As simple as that.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:24.000
I don't know what is white coding, don't worry, that's something that I have to teach you.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Yeah? So you decided to mention that course can access ABLE for a lifetime?

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Uh, no, here we have clearly mentioned… I think someone has uploaded a wrong poster, but here it's clearly mentioned, one-year access.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Yeah? Dude will leave you on those things, like, maybe some team member have, by mistake, like, done that, but yeah.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:57.000
So, since at day zero, it's a one-year access. Uh, what you will do with Lighttime, so… doesn't make sense, right? So, maybe in the next two years itself, a lot of technology is going to change.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Uh, okay, now so many questions for me. So, shall we start at, like, a conversation, guys?

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Yeah? Shall we open up our mic now? I think, like, I'm able to discuss everything with respect to Euron, so I can see a lot of caution, and even you guys are able to see a lot of caution. So I believe, like, now we should start talking.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Yeah. And I hope all of you are able to join inside, uh.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Group, your, uh, your WhatsApp group means this badge WhatsApp group.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Yes? Okay, fine. So, uh… We have so many attendees, uh, here.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:51.000
And don't worry, again, so… Uh, your mentor is not new in a mentorship, so I know how to handle a batches, I know how to answer the doubts, I know how to clarify each and every concern that you have.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:20:03.000
I'm doing it since last 8 years, so be patient in a very day zero. It looks like, uh, like, okay, my turn, my turn, and someone is supposed to answer my question, but believe me, I will be here.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Uh, by the time, I'm not going to close all of your doubt, and that is going to happen every Saturday and Sunday.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Yeah, that is going to happen every Saturday, Sunday. Um, I have mentioned only 2 hours of timeline, but that is just a timeline I have mentioned.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:20.000
I'll listen and they are not going to close all of your doubts.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:27.000
I am not going to leave the class. Now. So, generally, I do a discussion, and after a discussion… so, this kind of a discussion.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:33.000
After that discussion, if you don't have a doubt, it's completely fine, you can drop off from the class, yeah?

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:46.000
And this is what we are going to do. So, because you're not supposed to sit for 4 hours, simple. So, classes are going to happen for one and a half hour, two hours, someday, two and a half hour, right? And if you don't have any kind of a question, simple, you can drop off from the class.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Uh, you have a WhatsApp group access and everything. If you have a question, you can stay over here and, uh, simple raise your hand.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000
I believe all of you are able to see this raise hand option, right guys?

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:10.000
I'm going to lower all of your hands so that you can raise it again, yeah? I believe all of you are able to see the raise hand option. Fine. So those who have a question, guys, please raise your hand, right? And one by one, I'm going to unmute, one by one, I'm going to answer. If you have a question again.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Again, you can raise your hand as many times as possible. I don't have, like I said, and I will keep on saying, I don't have any issue with any question, and one by one.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Uh, let's try to, like, ask a question, yes? Uh, fine. So, Nahendra, Karthik, Rameshram, Krishna, please go ahead with your question.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Yep. Nangid Raf first.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Oh, thankfully, uh… Do we have any security… data security issues when we are using this generated AI?

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Data security chapter you're talking about?

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Oh, I'm asking, uh… whether any, um, when we upload data.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Getting, uh… is this going to be any threatened? So the clients, if we are using client data, no?

01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:06.000
No, not at all, not at all, not at all. Yeah. So, you're talking about the URI, basically, right? So when you are going to use a Yuri, or when you are going to use a URI API, so you are saying that.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:10.000
That, uh, like, uh, are we storing your data, or, like, are we keeping your data? Something like this, right?

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:24.000
No. We are not keeping your data loud and clear, I can mention. We are not storing your data. Plus, let me show you a URI. So, for example, let me share my screen once again.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:35.000
And, uh, here… Uh, if I'll go to Yuri, so we have an option. So, where you can go to a setting.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:41.000
And then you can try to delete all your chat. You can try to even import your chat.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Again, so this has been hosted on our server, means on our server. So, this.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Chat, you can try to come over here, you can try to delete it. We are, like, storing this chat over here, just inside the Yuri ecosystem.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:09.000
So that it will help us to build a memory. So whenever you will come next time, it understands you, right? System understands you. But we have already given an option, your data is your data, it's not our data, simple, and we are not training any kind of a model, by the way.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Right? We are not training… as I said, so it's not a model that we have modified, it's the same model that you will find out in any market.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Right? It's the same model. Whether this is GPT, so we are using GPT. But yes, it's always hosted on our platform.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:32.000
And, uh, we are, like, trying to do it inferencing with respect to the GPT's API, and there are some proprietary models which we have hosted, right? Which we are hosted, and from there, we are, like, doing inferencing.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Uh, so we are not storing any data. With respect to Yuri, and even with respect to Yuri API, right? So, we are not even storing, like, anything, any data with respect to a memory.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:51.000
So you are, you are basically, like, secured, you can try to use it with respect to your client data, or with respect to your MVPs you are going to build, or any, like, POCs you are going to build.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Hope it makes sense, Nagindra, yeah? Yeah, please go ahead.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Yeah, one more click on that. I recently used this PDF documentation summarization.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:01.000
So, in which, uh, I hope, uh, the token number might be crossed to 1 lakh, I think so.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Mm-hmm.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Will that be fine? Can we increase this token size?

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:17.000
So, see, uh, daily token limit, you, uh, we are going to reset for you, uh, as we have already mentioned, and we are giving you 1 lakh.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:31.000
And, uh, see, we have created this Euron platform, keeping one thing in our mind, so that as a learner, you will be using it, right? As a learner, you will be using it. Not in a, like, a production hour. If you're going to use our API in a production, just imagine how much it is going to cost us.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Well, actually, uh, the document size is more than 92, so it is not producing admits what we expected.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:44.000
So, you, use, you… No, no, no, you use a sample gnome. So just try to use one or two pages, why to use the 92 pages?

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:56.000
If something is going to work for two pages, it is going to work for 200 pages as well, right? So, we have given this ecosystem so that you can learn, you can experiment, you can build up POCs, you can build up MVPs.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Uh, not to use our API just directly with the client interfacing.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:09.000
Right? You can use it, because our API is as stable as any other API that you will be able to find out. There is no downtime at all with respect to this API system.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:15.000
But we are limiting you with respect to a token in our future, we are even planning, right?

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:23.000
To bring some flexible token limit as well. So, where you can buy. Like, like you said, right? So, let's suppose you are processing 100 pairs of document.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:34.000
So, obviously, a system can do it, there is no issue. The only limitation will be a token limit. So, in a future, I'm, like, planning that if some of my user would like to, like, you know.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:38.000
I want an unlimited token. Go for pay-per-use.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:57.000
On top of this one, on top of this token availability limit, so go for pay-per-use, so that you will not be having any kind of a limitation in that case. But as of now, we are giving you, for learning purposes, and I think one lakh token daily is more than enough, because you will not be consuming, like, this much token on a daily basis. It's a 365 lakh, you have access of over 1 year.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Right? The 365 lakh, so I don't think that… Anyone will be able to use it. I have never seen that.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Yeah. So, elaborate APIs. So, APIs, in a layman way, I'll say API is something, a kind of an endpoint, so which is giving you an access of all the model out there.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:27.000
But, uh, technical… in a technical way, I'll explain to you API… In a class. Yeah? Okay, fine. Karthik, please go ahead.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Um, just one… actually, more of a… not of a question, but of a suggestion that.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Mm-hmm.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Uh, when we do have this Q&A sessions, like, can we limit people, uh, to, you know, just discuss the topic or the previous topics, rather than going for something advanced?

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Because sometimes during these sessions, what happens?

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:54.000
No, no, no, seek… seek article, I'll tell you from my experience, that on a first couple of classes, you will fill in that way.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Meet me, uh, there won't be much of doubt. Right? And, uh, slowly and gradually, as we are going to move, so you will be able to find out that there are many people who are discussing things in a group, there are many people who have already discussed in live classes.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:24.000
So, this doubt will keep on reducing. Don't worry about it, and I never restrict. So even tomorrow, if you have any kind of a question, maybe a personal question, or maybe you would like to talk about something XYZ, which is not relevant to this particular class only, you can come and ask, so that's completely fine. So I never restrict anyone.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.000
Nope. Okay, thank you.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:30.000
And I'm willing to give a proper time. I'm not limiting that I'm in a 2-hour, I'm going to close this session. No, not at all.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:34.000
So, unless I'm not closing all the doubt, I'm not going to close the session.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.000
Yeah? Yeah. Yeah, so fine. Uh, Krishna, please go ahead.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Perfect, yep, thank you.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.000
Yeah, hi Sudan Shuk. I've been with you for the far, uh, you know, last 5 years.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Hi, hi, yeah. I remember, I remember. I know your name.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Good. Yes.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:56.000
We… we just talked, like, every day. Yeah, I had done multiple transitions. I hate to, uh, you know, switch companies.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Considering the work environment, but I do freelancing and all, and I earn more than my salary, just because of.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Okay. Hm. Yes.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Mm-hmm.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:24.000
I knew. I have been with DataSense. But for the couple of months, I lost the touch of technology due to my client locations and all, so I… curious, like, how did one LLM, you know, one API key gives access to multiple LLMs? That's what I, you know…

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Yes.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:32.000
So basically, okay, okay, so basically you were saying that how, with the help of one API key? See, technically, what we are doing over here, so, for every model, right, so you will be able to see a model ID, so we have already given you the identifier.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Yes, so there is a model ID that we have given to you. Now, whenever you go over here and try to create the API key, so basically, that is just an access point. Whenever we are trying to hit the model, so we are saying that, okay, fine, so just try to hit this model with this model ID.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:59.000
You are anyhow passing the model ID, right? So basically, it segregates from the model ID. Api key is basically a password. For example, so whenever you log in into the Euron system, yeah, so you log in with only one ID and password, right?

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.000
But there are multiple things that you are able to access.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Understood. Yes.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Same philosophy. Yeah, so it's the same philosophy that we need.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Okay, got it, got it, got it. Can, uh, Sudan Shu, can we have this as an, you know, at the end of the project, uh, course, can we have this as a walkthrough?

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Uh, it's a complex system. It will take time. Mm-hmm.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:24.000
No, no, not the entire, not the entire SDK stuff. Like, how can we build a simple AP to access multiple LLMs?

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:33.000
That, uh… see, anyhow, I'm going to teach you hosting a LLM on a GPU, right, and inferencing it, because UD project is already mentioned, right?

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.000
So, maybe we'll try to add a couple of things over there.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Yep, yep. Yeah, yeah, thanks, thanks for that, thanks a lot.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Okay, yeah, yeah, okay, thank you. Okay, so, yeah, please go ahead, please go ahead, yes.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Is that true?

01:29:43.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Yeah, so I was just saying, this is in line with the first speaker. Uh, considering the data security, uh, so can we… I mean, can you teach us one or two projects, like, how we can build some offline LLMs that can be used within the data.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.000
It's already there, so…

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:15.000
And we can create our own use cases for them. Yeah, I saw you were speaking about Langchain and a few other things.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Good night.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:29.000
No, no, no, no, no, not Langchen, not Langchain. So here, this section, so Langchen is a framework, so by which you will be able to create agents, basically, and you will be able to do a tool calling. So, technically, you will be able to create agents, or maybe multiple agents, or chaining you will be able to do, but.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Correct, yeah.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:37.000
As you are talking about, uh, creating our own model, right? On our own data set, this is the section where model, this is called as model fine-tuning. So, we can fine-tune a LLM model, largely model.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:55.000
We can fine-tune a SLM model, and these are the philosophy, LoRa, Quora. So based on that, we try to fine-tune it, or maybe a quantization. So, this is already a part of your syllabus, where we will be, like, fine-tuning.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:04.000
That idea.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:05.000
Okay.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Our own model on my own data, not some open source data. So let's suppose I have maybe a 510 line of data, right? So I'll be teaching you that particular part. I have already taught even that particular part in a complete practical manner. If you will go and check my previous classes. Like, previous life classes, the name was Generative AI with NLP, uh, yeah, Generative AI with NLP, this one.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Lag, I believe some… you spoke something in, uh, RAG class.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Okay.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Generative AI with… Uh, no, let me show it to you. Yeah, this one. So, Genitive AI with NLP, and this was my previous live badge. So, this I have already concluded. This was launched on March 8th, basically, right? In a live mode. So even over here, if you will come, you will be able to see, uh.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:42.000
8th June lecture, so where I have already taught about model fine-tuning, and that two theory practical C, we are fine-tuning the model based on the LoRa.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Philosophy and Quora philosophy, right? We are fine-tuning on a hugging face. So everything, everything.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:51.000
I think my video will not be visible, right? This video.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:54.000
No, that's fine, I can just go and check it out. That's not approved.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Yeah, yeah, so interface is visual, because we do DRM product, right? So, in a screen sharing, it will not be visible. You can go and check 8 June lecture from that one. So, I have already discussed, and even in this batch, so I'm going to discuss in more depth and in a more intense way.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:10.000
But yeah, that is already a part of… we'll be building our own model as well.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yes, yes, you are audible, please go ahead.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Mm-hmm.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:26.000
Hi, Sudan Shu. Am I audible? Yeah, yeah, so I have a question. So, you spoke about internship, right? So, is it like, uh… Uh, is it like a project, or is it like you are offering some internship to some candidates, I mean?

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:34.000
No, no, no, so I'm, like, offering you the experience. I'm not offering you any kind of a money, I'm not offering you any kind of a compensation, by the way, I'm offering you an experience.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Uh, because at the end of the day, you need a letter, you have to go, and you have to showcase in your college you are applying for the next project, or maybe just you have to get the experience, right? That, okay, fine, so how real-time project works?

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:51.000
This is where our internship project portal comes into a picture, and there is no separate offering inside this one.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Simple. It's one of the features that we have built for my student, so that anyone will be able to work with respect to a real time, or near real-time projects.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Yeah. Excellent.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Thank you. Yeah.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Getting the defensive, uh, uh, hello?

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Good morning.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Hello, am I audible?

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:24.000
Yeah, hope it makes sense. Just wait, just wait. Just wait. I'll come to you. Let me, like, close the previous question. Yeah, so… Please go ahead. The previous one. One by one, guys. There are not much… Yeah, so I think previous people… Krishna or someone was asking the question, right? Regarding internship.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:25.000
Okay, so question is done? Okay, okay, then great. Okay.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:29.000
Uh, yes, sir, I was asking.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Hello, am I audible?

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:31.000
Can you call the name Sudan, because it's confusing.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Yeah, please go ahead. Yeah, yeah, I'm calling the name, yeah, I'm calling the name. So please, uh, Jivith, I can see. So, Jeevit, please go ahead.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Yeah. It's been quite a long connecting with iNeuron and you. I think it's… because it's Jenny.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:51.000
So, I just wanted to, uh, like, discuss with you specifically two things. I just wanted, like, out of curiosity, like.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Mm-hmm.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:59.000
It might be the starting of the session. So, right now, I'm currently working in data analysis, specifically for cybersecurity domain, in my.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.000
Okay.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Company, but I was just curious, like, how can I use this gen AI learnings.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:11.000
For my, like, project, I mean, for data analysis in the cybersecurity area.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Specifically, like, apart from chatbot things, so are there any other implementations that we can do?

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Obviously, like, see, even if I'll talk about the security, right? So, in terms of detecting anomalies, previously we used to build a lot of models, but now LLMs are way more powerful in terms of understanding the data, so we are using LLMs.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Even in terms of, like, filtering out, or even in terms of flagging out something. Now, if I'll talk about the data analysis. So, we try to write a lot of formulas over here. We try to write a lot of logic just to understand the data, just to align a data, or maybe filter out the data.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Again, pass sample data inside the LLMs, it will be able to do it without even writing a single line of code, or any kind of a rule, or filtration, right? So, scope-wise, it's too much. Previously, we used to, like, create all of those graphs and dashboards one by one, one by one. Now look into the Power BI, look into the Tableau, everyone has given you the AI assistance.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:23.000
So, just chat with it, it will be able to create the most of the dashboarding parts, right? Because it understands the data better than you. So, even if I'll talk about an EDA operation, or even I'll talk about the investigation of the data, or postpartum the data, so previously, we, like, look into those data, we try to talk to the client, and then we try to understand it, and there was a lot of back and forth, right? Now what do we do? So, copy the sample data, put it inside the LLMs, or maybe call some APIs.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:30.000
And, uh, it will give you a better explanation, maybe better than the people or person who is into that business, right?

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:31.000
So, obviously, you know, cybersecurity and everywhere, it's… see, large language model is something.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Yeah.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Which understands, uh, data, which understands something which has been written.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:47.000
In better way as compared to a human. And that's your quick, quickest possible way, right?

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:58.000
So everywhere, wherever we were using our understanding as a human, we were investing our time, we can just, like, use LLMs. And we are actually using it everywhere.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Okay, and one more thing, like, I remember, like, you were stressing in our previous batches specifically for.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Full stack and the end-to-end things, right? Mainly focused specifically for building, rather than the learning stuff.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:10.000
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:18.000
So, in today also, is there, like, end-to-end things, apart from, like, uh, doing… implementing specific, uh, modules or something like that?

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Uh, which one? Sorry, I didn't get the question.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:27.000
I mean, like, uh, I mean, it's my, like, understanding from your in-uron batches, so where machine learning or FHVS batches.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Mm-hmm. Okay?

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Mainly, like, apart from Kaggle kind of a project, where there was main focus for implementing the end-to-end projects.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:43.000
So that is… that is… that is there, right? So that is there in all the batches, I would say. So, even here, so end-to-end.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Because I never liked even… if you know, like, in Iran, so I never liked that kind of a project, right? So, that's the reason, so we have this end-to-end.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Yeah.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:58.000
I have just mentioned IURI itself, that, okay, let's go ahead and discuss Yuri.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Another thing can be bigger than this one, believe me, nothing can be bigger than this very first project, right?

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Okay, sure, sure, uh, so thanks.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Oh, okay.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Nothing means literally nothing. It's a real-time system, it's a system that we all are using it, right? And, uh, again, on a scale, just name anything, and that too, with the proprietary model, that too with the open source model, so everything will come.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:26.000
Just with one single project itself, a first one. Second, third, fourth, again, it is going to give you a lot of different experience.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Switzerland. Thank you.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Excellent, sir.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Yes, I'll call the name, yeah. So, Samir, please go ahead, yeah.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Yeah, so I mean, I can hear you.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Hi, spouse, you can hear me? Yes, so in the platform, I see two similar courses. One is Generative AI with NLP, which we just spoke about a few minutes back, and another is similar, like, FSDS.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:51.000
So, are we missing something in this course, the bootcamp, or do we have to pick a few topics from the other courses as well?

01:37:51.000 --> 01:38:13.000
No, not at all. So, you should not. Just focus on… only on this one, because, see, I keep on launching the batches, that is my job, right? So, obviously, I'll keep on bringing the batches, not just this one, again, this month, next month, and next to next month, every time. And every time, whenever I launch our batches, so what I do is that I try to add some topic, I try to subtract some topic, as per the current trend, which I feel.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:19.000
Right, as per my investigation and knowledge and the exploration which I do. Uh, but yeah, so at the end of the day.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Every batch is complete in itself. So, just focus on one, don't try to focus on multiple. It's completely fine. This is how things has been created.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Right? Because so many courses you have launched recently, that confuses.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:32.000
To some extent, that's very much. Okay. Thank you.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:43.000
No, just one, one, only one. Yeah, at a time, only one. I'll never recommend to go through a multiple things at any point of a time, yeah? Sameer?

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Uh, yeah, so don't you, uh, so it's a great landscape.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:49.000
Yeah, Ramiz Kumar, please go ahead with your question.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Thank you. Mm-hmm.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:53.000
So, I have some questions from this, and focus system, right? It's just a game like that? It's a kind of a game?

01:38:53.000 --> 01:39:10.000
No, it's, uh, uh, not a game, I would say, so just, basically, let's suppose I'm a distracted person, right? So, I see Insta and Facebook and all those things.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Okay.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:21.000
And during our work. So what we have done, what my team has done that, that you can try to put a timer over here, that, okay, so this timer is running, and then you are leaving all these things apart, and you can try to even, like, uh… because some people, like, you know, like, uh, nature or music or something like that, right?

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:22.000
So there is a technique in Japan called as ikigai technique to focus, basically.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:30.000
To build a focus. So, based on that, we have built this entire thing.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:31.000
Yeah, nice.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:52.000
So just a simple, simple app. Just to, like, help you out. Nothing related with, like, this badge or that badge. It's in general. Because nowadays, we all are distracted, are very, very distracted, right? You can keep track of it, that, okay, how much I'm able to focus, how much I'm not able to focus, how many times I've taken a break, or, like, you know, how many times, basically.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Uh, like, I got distracted. Everything you will be able to see, so that, uh, you know, you can be a better person, or better, maybe, anything.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Uh-huh.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:11.000
Yes, obviously!

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Lucas… Yeah, yeah, sounds good. Yeah, my second question is that, uh, the job portal, right? The job portal, we are probably, yes, uh… So, can I also apply the job? Because we usually follow… based on the LinkedIn here. So, how are you going to pitch the jobs?

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Can I use this prompt?

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:27.000
So basically, see, like I said, that we are learning, right? So, see, we are not producing a job, we are basically aggregating it, L-A-N-I-N-G.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:33.000
Yeah, so we are basically aggregating a job from n number of… okay, spelling mistake.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:46.000
Um, yeah. So, we are basically aggregating a job from the multiple platforms out there so that you should not go. So, basically, when you are going to click on this Apply, so it is going to basically send you on a different, different platform where this job was actually available or published.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:53.000
Mm-hmm.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Okay.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Like I said, it's an aggregator platform. Right? It's alligator platform. We are not allowing anyone, or we are not even asking anyone to come and post it. So, for my student, this is one of the services we are trying to build. Uh, yeah, so this gets refreshed in a real time.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:13.000
Uh, so Wells Fargo jobs… what happened? Yeah, so just to rephrase one… Yeah, maybe… Tom?

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:21.000
No, okay. Yeah, so, yeah, actually, I offered the… no, you guys, you offered the course, various courses. Actually, I bought this course.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Specific course, can I access the recording as for that? Or, can I…

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.000
Yeah…

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:44.000
Ah, yes! So, access, which one? If you have bought only one courses, right? See, we have basically two… two planners of now. So, one is a Euron+. Euron Plus means… so basically, in one single plan, everything will be accessible, everything means literally everything will be accessible for the entire year.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:57.000
And then we have our individual course. So, if someone… and again, Euron Plus is also… because, see, we have launched these live batches, and again, this interview bootcamp is going to come up, right? We have already made announcement. Then, next one will come, then next one will come.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:07.000
So every month, new, new things will keep on coming. So, just my students are not supposed to go ahead and buy batches again and again and again, at least for an entire year.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:15.000
So, keeping that in mind, we have a plus plan, right? So, if anyone is having a plus plan, then they can access it for a one particular year.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:22.000
If someone has, uh, like, taken only one single live batches, then obviously that live batches will be available to you.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:26.000
Okay, yeah, actually, right now, I bought only live batches, that's why I'm asking.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.000
Okay.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Because you have conducted the wood batch, right? But can't we have a chance to look at the video then? That's why I'm asking.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:41.000
Uh, no, that is available just with the Euron+, and we are not selling even the previous classes, so that is already a part of, basically, Euron+.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:48.000
And, uh, yeah, so anyone and everyone, those who's having a Euron Plus, because I think most of the people go ahead with the Euron+.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:43:01.000
So, they will be able to see it. But, uh, not otherwise. And again, so those who would like to upgrade, so maybe you can talk to a team, right? And then, like, whatever differential will be there, right? So you can just talk to them.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:07.000
And then, uh, they are going to give you an access after a payment of that differential, where at least for one year.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Every feature, all the batches, all the materials, everything you will be able to access seamlessly, for one year.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Yeah, so anyhow, even live batches I'm giving you for one year itself.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Okay, that's per only.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:21.000
So anything and everything comes with one year.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Yeah. I know, uh… Yeah, one more thing, Rishi, may I part, right? And we are able to see the 1-3 model.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:34.000
Uh, so, are you… can we see there's some different template that only we are able to see 3 templates only then?

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:35.000
Let us show me a…

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Where, where? Yeah, so we have given you only 3 templates. I have already mentioned, right? So, only 3 templates we have given to you, because, uh, see, I can create hundreds of templates over here, but again, that creates a lot of confusion with… among the people.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:48.000
So, keeping that in our mind, 3 standard, polished, well-formatted template we have given to you, and only 3 is available.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Mm-hmm.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Okay.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:44:01.000
If many people will say that, okay, fine, so try to bring… So, bringing 5 more templates will not be a big deal for us.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:06.000
But I think it will create more of confusion among the people.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:12.000
Yeah, okay, nice. And also, for every class, would you provide the assessments for each and every class?

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Where are you going?

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:23.000
So basically, I give a coursework, basically. So, I will give you a lot of, like, challenges and a project that is… my very, very old style of conducting a batch.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:31.000
Okay. Yeah, because why I'm asking for the practice purpose, at least what we learned to the specific class.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:32.000
Can we implement that over and so it is good to use.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:38.000
Exactly, so I'm going to give you a lot of coursework and challenges. So, basically, I keep on launching challenges in my badge.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:44.000
It's a little bit different style that I used to follow. Uh, but yeah, so you will get a lot of work to do.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:50.000
Yeah, yeah, sure. Yes, finally, one more request, actually. Some more work, John.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Different country is late, right? 11 o'clock or 12 o'clock, something. Right now, my time is almost.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:56.000
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Mm-hmm.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:03.000
11 o'clock. So, is it possible to at least get the opportunity to talk, uh, any questions earlier? That should be well and good.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:04.000
For the restaurant time zone.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:10.000
No, that's fine. See, believe me, you will not be having a lot of questions, basically on a regular basis.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:25.000
And, uh, I understand, uh, time zone constraint. So, anyhow, I'm in your group, inside a WhatsApp, right? So, in your time zone, don't try to stretch yourself much, I would say. Take a proper rest, take a proper sleep, and then whenever you are available, whatever question you have.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:30.000
We are now connected in a WhatsApp group, and we will be connected even after one year.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:31.000
Okay, yeah.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:47.000
Right? Even after 5 years. So, it's not like… and it's not like I'm not going to answer. That's the reason, so you will be able to see many of my students, so who are a student since last four years, 5 years, they have done a multiple tension, but still they used to join the batch.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:48.000
Oh, good. Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Right? And still, we are connected. So, I believe in that kind of a sentiment and relation. So don't worry, your question is not going anywhere, and you don't have to stretch much about your questions, so don't think much on that level, yeah?

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Yeah, thanks, thanks. Okay, so Ritik, please go ahead. Yeah, ridiculous.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:06.000
Hello, am I audible? Yeah, yeah. Uh, actually, I went, uh, one year of experience in a Python backend development.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:07.000
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Now I want to just transition into the… Jenny, I asked for the ML or DL is recover this?

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Uh, MLR deal is required, whatever portion is required, I will cover. It's my responsibility, not your job.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Yeah. Yeah. Sumit, please go ahead. Sumit Sahu.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:30.000
Yeah, yeah, Sumit, please go ahead. Yes, yes, you are available. Go ahead, please.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Hello, hello, Suzan. Am I audible? There are a lot of thanks for the opportunity for this course, because I have already a student of your IME and I got transitioned to the… this, uh, DAP.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:47.000
Let's do it again, then, so… Okay.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:48.000
Okay.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:47:06.000
And, sir, in that, uh, FSD is fast badge, I am a student, so there is… I got a very good… you gave one very good assignment, uh, means, like, uh, to implement all the MN flow and the, uh, AWS stuff. That still helps to get the job, and still it is working also. So, I just want to confirm this batch also. Just the request, sir.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:07.000
Please do this type of assessment, so it will be modest.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:18.000
I'm the… I'm the same… I'm the same person, right? So, obviously, how I can leave my old nature?

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:24.000
Yeah.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:25.000
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:29.000
Yes, it is. Yes, sir, yes, and also, sir, I have another request, so I also want to learn the big data course. I have joined this urine class also. I have joined one class, but due to some other reasons, I'm not able to continue that Peak Data class. Can you just guide me which one to… I can, uh, go through so that, uh, that will also help you, uh.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Mm-hmm. Yeah, so, okay, big data-wise, see, I have created a big data track, like I have mentioned, uh, that, uh.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:56.000
Uh, big data track is available, but as of now, because of, you can say, procrastination, because of me being lazy, or whatever term, right? So, I'm not able to upload a recording continuously, but as I have launched.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:23.000
In a hybrid mode. So, obviously, it will be completed. So this is about this one. Now, recently, I have concluded one big data batch in live mode as well, so I think it was a live view. This was the live badge, right? So, this big data, live batches has started December. I think 8 months back, and this patch I have already completed. So, if you are, like, trying to explore up big data immediately, then this live batch is available, but again.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:24.000
Okay.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:34.000
The current track which I have released, it is having much more in-depth, like, entire curriculum with respect to our big data. Azure, big data, AWS, Big Data, Databricks, and Big Data Core.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:35.000
Okay, sir.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:48.000
Uh, basically. The current track, the roadmap I have created. But, uh… you have to wait for… you have to give me some time, basically, to… for the current one, and otherwise, you can go with the live.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:49.000
Yeah.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:54.000
Okay, no, no, I have a lot of trust, because I'm always a student from, uh, that is, currently it is more than 4 years, so I always feel happy with the platform and the University.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:49:03.000
Thank you, thank you. Yeah, thanks. Thanks. Again, yeah, Navneet, uh, no, you have not raised a hand. Sam, please go ahead.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:14.000
Yeah, uh, thank you for the opportunity. Just want to check, so… I don't have, uh, you know, Python coding experience, or for that matter, for the last 5-6 years, no coding experience.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:20.000
But I'm in IT, so just wanted to check, uh, while I'm starting with this course.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Is there anything that I need to do? Uh, to make sure I keep… my base with the ghost.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:32.000
Just, just, just, just do one thing. So, I have already mentioned, uh, like, a pre-recorded, uh, basically a fresh recording, uh, Python videos.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:45.000
More through not all, I would say, but some, starting from the beginning. So that you will be aware about, little bit about the system setup, and a little bit about the variables, or maybe a for loop, while loop.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:46.000
Okay.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:50:02.000
And, uh, again, this is a crisp, short, and precise videos. Maybe I spent 2-3 hours of time, not more than that, because I know it's, like, literally tough for anyone to, you know, complete everything in one go if you're not coming from that background. But yeah, that's just my recommendation. So maybe you can spend next one week of time, and just spend two, three.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Maybe, like, every day, or, like, half an hour, maybe 45 minutes of time, yeah? You will be comfortable in that way.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:16.000
Okay. Okay, and the other thing… I know I'm being ambitious, but let's say, uh, you know, in future, uh.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:21.000
So, if I want to, uh, refer to any of the recorded.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Sessions, you know, in addition to the live batches on Saturday, Sunday, let's say from Monday to Friday, if I need to.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:30.000
If I have some time to refer to some recorded, uh, course.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:31.000
I am a member of Euron+, so which course should I refer to?

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:36.000
Hm.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:37.000
Yes, yes. Yeah.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:47.000
Uh, with respect to generative AI you are talking about? Only with transportation native AI. Okay, so I'll simply say it's just, uh, because we have a lot of live classes, but once you will go through live classes, right, so live classes happens for 2 hour, 4 hour.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:48.000
Yeah.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:51:02.000
So, basically, if it's not your live class, you will find it a little bit difficult, so just go ahead with our roadmap, where inside our roadmap, I have not mentioned a live classes, it's already there, but yeah, I have not mentioned it. I have mentioned, basically, all the recorded one.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Okay. Okay.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:19.000
Yeah, so just follow along with the track. So, RAG is also done. So, basically, RAG is done from this track, MCP is also done completely. Llm master is also done. Uh, the thing which is not done is basically this one. Nlp…

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:31.000
I think only 3 modules is pending, so in NLP section. Stats, I think, 2 or 3 model is pending. Python core, almost on the verge of completion. So, you can just follow along with this track.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:32.000
Okay.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Almost this stack is getting completed, almost, I would say. And 3-4 courses already we have completed, NLP, RIG, and MCP, it's already closed, plus LLM Ops, so yeah. Out of this track, so let's suppose in this track, 1, 2, 3, 4.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:46.000
5, 6, 7… so out of 7, 4 is already closed.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:47.000
Okay, and uh…

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:54.000
And that, too, in a premium recordings, so basically you will not get bored, and you don't have to go through a lengthy 2 hour of, like, a live lecture.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:52:04.000
Okay, and last question from my side. So, I don't have a background on machine learning, etc, but still, I can directly jump on this one, right?

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:05.000
Okay.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:11.000
Yes, uh, see, all these payrequisite of stats and all these things is not required, right? So, again, we are mature enough to adopt, and we are mature enough to learn anything. Uh, so it's a myth.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:15.000
That you have to learn ABCD, then only you will be able to form a sentence.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Okay, okay. Yeah, that helps.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Yeah. Generally, people think that, that, no, you have to be a master in a Python, then you have to get a master into a statistics, whole mathematics on a PhD level, you should know, and then you have to learn all those, like, 20, 30 machine learning algorithms. Then, NLP, then deep learning, then computer vision. I mean, like.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
A world that doesn't work in this way, and especially the world of AI. So.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:38.000
Okay. Thank you so much. Thanks.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:52.000
I never recommend that approach. Yeah, thanks. Okay, so Asis, please go ahead. After that, Ranjit, please go ahead. After that, uh… Uh, yeah, Asis, please go ahead. Masis, your turn.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:53.000
Yeah, Aziz, you're audible.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:53:04.000
Uh, high residence, am I edible? So, sir, my, uh, like, I had some, uh… Basic level of question. So, I'm working as a… support guide, so I do not have any experience on language.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:07.000
Okay. Okay?

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:15.000
So, like, I'm really scaring about, like, uh, are you going to teach us from the basic level, or, like, uh… In, uh…

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:30.000
See, language I have clearly mentioned, so language I will not teach. The reason is very simple. Uh, it takes a lot of time, because when I say language, so I literally start from a very, very basic. Very basic means, like, a variable declaration, system setup, and all those things.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:35.000
Right. So, that's the reason, so I have mentioned that, uh, like, uh, mentioned my recording itself, uh.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:53.000
And that tweets are crisp and precise recording, so it will not consume more… much of your time, and again, you will not feel bored over there. So, I'll simply suggest to you that try to spend next week of time, every day, on average, half an hour, 45 minutes of time, and not complete everything. I'm not expecting that to go ahead and complete everything, no.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Uh, that is not a requirement. I'm just telling you that go ahead and watch.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Simple. Yeah? Just go ahead and watch, and then come to the classes, because even in class, when I will do a live coding, right.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:16.000
I'll do a line-by-line coding, at least in a beginning. So, once we will be in our mid, then I will start you doing a live coding, I'll start copy and… I'll start doing a copy and paste off a big, big block of the codes.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:25.000
But initially, I will be doing a live coding inside the class. This is how I take the classes, and line by line, I'm going to write the code, line by line, I'm going to give you the explanation.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:31.000
So at least you can say, like, first one, one and a half month, or portion.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:41.000
Yeah? So that even you will be able to revise a Python, or even if you're not coming from the pure coding background, you will be able to cope up. Because I understand that it's a problem with everyone, not just with one.

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:42.000
Right? Yeah. Yeah.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:52.000
Okay, so sort of, you mean to say, like, in the… Uh, the live AI batch, you already… there is, like, some, uh… Python videos are there, so we just need to ask those.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:55:01.000
Yes? Just, just, just watch. I'm not saying that completely assignment, complete everything, no, not at all. That is not required, yeah? See, Python video is already available.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
I think you're able to see my screen, right? Yeah, so 38… 38 videos already there.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Yes, sir.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:14.000
But, yeah, some videos will be, like, having a length of 5 minute, 10 minutes, 20 minute. So, in this way, it's a fresh recording which I have done.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:18.000
And again, I have a lot of, like, a Python video. In Hindi language as well as in English language, in both the languages.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Okay.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:29.000
Yeah? So just go ahead and watch. Don't, like, try to give a lot of, like, stress to yourself. See, it's not that tough to learn or code, right? So, it's just a mindset.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:39.000
I would say. So, if you have that kind of a mindset, a proper aligned mindset, uh, in 3 to 4 months, you will be able to eventually learn and build anything.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Yep.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Okay. So, one more thing, and earlier videos, but the roadmap videos you just told, we just need to learn the mathematics. Some other, other things you have mentioned to learn.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:48.000
Then after we can be the, like, you know, long runner on this Gen AI field.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:52.000
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:58.000
So, still we are expecting those things to be covered in this, uh, uh, you know, lightweights.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Hmm, obviously, yes. Yeah.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:08.000
Okay, sir. So, Sarm Manil, my last question. So, what actually we do in Gen AI?

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:09.000
Like, uh… eh?

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:15.000
Mm-hmm. Uh, for that, you have joined the badge, but yeah, so as a layman, if I have to explain you, right?

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:33.000
V… Gen AI is basically our latest way of doing on automation. See, automation is something that we know since 2-3 decade, right? So, we try to automate maybe some of the processes, or maybe we try to automate some of the systems, machine or framework, by writing some rules.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:40.000
So this is what we have been doing since the two or three decades. We have been writing our rules that if this is going to happen, then do this, then do this, then do this.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:51.000
And most of the software industry has, like, been automated in that particular manner so far. Two and a half years back. Now, so now we are talking about, uh.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:57:10.000
Automation, right? But in an intelligent way, because these LLMs, right, the large language model, ChatGPT kind of a model, Cloud A, uh… a model from a cloud here, model from a Gemini. So, these can understand, or this is having some sort of a human label understanding in terms of, like, understanding your system or data.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:20.000
Or maybe a command, or you say anything, right? So, with the help of now this one, we are going ahead with a super automation, and eventually, that is named as a agents.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:28.000
So once I'll get into agent, once we are going to build the agent, even we are going to automate a lot and lot of tasks. For example, so.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:47.000
You don't have to go and look into your Gmail. So, your agent is going to reply back, right? So, maybe you are building a support system, so where your agent will be live, and agent will keep on basically replying to your customer. You can try to build, uh, basically, a sales representative. So, where sales representative will be able to call to your customer.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:51.000
And then it will be able to talk, it will be able to convince, it will be able to even sell the product. And nowadays it's happening.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:58:04.000
You must have received a lot of calls from banks, right? Or maybe from some of the, like, startup or organization who would like to sell you a product, but on the other side, it's not a human who is talking, but it looks like that, yes, it's a human.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:15.000
Right? So again, that is one of the use cases. Let's suppose, let's talk about a movie making, right? So previously, director, producer, and actors, and everyone comes together, they write their script, they do each and everything, they create the movies.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:30.000
Now we have a, like, a… VO kind of a system, so where it will be able to produce even a movie in a creative way. Previously, there was basically a designer who tried to design a thumbnail and each and everything. Now you can just give one single prompt into a chat GPT, it will be able to design for you.

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:35.000
Basically. So, I think I've given you the enough example, right?

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:36.000
Yes, yes, yes.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:41.000
And so, these are the things that happen. So, just let's look around you, right? Look around you, look into any apps, just open up.

01:58:41.000 --> 01:59:04.000
Any app nowadays, right, so everywhere you will be able to find out an AI integration. Yeah, previously recommended system we used to build, so there was a time two decades back, so when, based on the rules, we have built a recommended system. Then there was a time, so when we had trained our machine learning kind of algorithm, or deep learning kind of a neural network, and we have built that recommended system. Now it's a time for LLMs. Now, even we are using LLMs, even in uron systems, so we have used, technically, LLMs.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:09.000
To give you a course recommendation that you see in a second and third bar.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:15.000
So, basically, it's nothing new, I would say, right? Uh, yeah, the approach has changed.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:22.000
Obviously, right? Previously, it was that we were following a different approach, now we are following a different approach, and we are saying, uh.

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:26.000
Agentic AI, generative AI. The immunity test. Yes?

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:30.000
Yeah. So, sir, my last question is, like. You are, like, you know, just telling it very, very nicely. So, suppose, like, you know.

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:36.000
Mm-hmm.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:40.000
As a support guy, sometimes we just need to do testing, like, on our project, so I'm working on a banking project.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:43.000
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:51.000
So, sir, can we complete… after completing this, uh… course, can we do something for our project?

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:52.000
Believe me, nowadays, no one is writing a test cases. It's AI who writes the test cases.

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:55.000
Like…

01:59:55.000 --> 02:00:01.000
Uh-huh.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:02.000
Okay.

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:12.000
So obviously, you will be able to use it directly. Yes. So, no one… who writes our test cases nowadays? I have not seen, like, in the last one year, one and a half year, that someone is writing a test cases even for the big project, right? It's AI.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
Which is writing a complete test cases.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:18.000
So, still in the US, many people choose to write the test cases.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:23.000
I mean, like, see, eventually there will be, like, a… they will change, they will change the approach.

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:33.000
Yeah? Because I had a lot of, like, a connection with a lot of people from a different, different continent, including a USA, and now people are saying that, yes, now it's open for all of us to use an AI.

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:43.000
No one is stopping us, and again, majority of the company have self-hosted a model in their own environment because of data security and all those things, and they have given an access to all of their people.

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:48.000
And if they have not done that, right. Wait for 6 months, they will do it.

02:00:48.000 --> 02:01:02.000
Okay, sir. Sir, for the testing purpose, also, we can use GenAI, but there is, like, some different approaches there. So, are you going to do those things, like, you know, how a… testing perspective, like, how we are going to use for the NAI. So, are you going to take.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:15.000
The project that I'm going to teach you, right? So, over there, we'll be writing a test cases, but I will not be writing that, AI will write that.

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:16.000
Hello, Susan.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:23.000
Yeah, yeah. So… Yeah, so, uh, Bhav, please go ahead. One by one, guys, I think we are having an interesting discussion, all of you are enjoying it.

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:24.000
Hello, sir. Hello.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:30.000
Yeah. So yeah, Babo. And I know, like, this is a day zero, right? So we all have a lot of questions, so it's fine. Yeah, please… Okay.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:37.000
So I really admire you. Thank you for loving me. I just was having a general question.

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:38.000
So I've been working with IT, like, it's been 45, 4.5 to 5 years.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:42.000
Yeah, Bevo.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:43.000
Into some, like, other technical stack, database Linux, Unix, and on Java.

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:47.000
Mm-hmm.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:50.000
So, I was just, like, pretty much interested to have, uh.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:57.000
Career transition, because there were no growth quite here, so I had decided to do career transition to some different domain, like data science.

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:58.000
Mm-hmm.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:04.000
Which indeed, uh, interest to me, but I was thinking, like, if it's… I'm late to have the career transition right now, because.

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:12.000
It's been 5 years, and the industry will expect me to… Be a candidate, having experience of 5 years into that particular domain.

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:28.000
People see Baba, people does that, uh, even after a 12-13 year. And as far as experience is concerned, right? So we all know that inside the IT industry, so 95 or 95 plus percent people are not coming from a CS background, they are maybe coming from a civil.

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:38.000
They're going from mechanical, they're coming from electrical, they're coming from a different sort of a background, and they're still working in IT industry, right? So, this is how this IT industry has been.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:41.000
Built. So it gives you a leverage, it gives you, like, all the opportunities.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:49.000
Uh, the only matter of fact is skills. So it doesn't matter whether you have a 5 year of experience, doesn't matter whether you are coming from XYZ kind of a background.

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:55.000
For the IT industry, as far as you have a skill, as far as you can prove it, as far as you can talk about it.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:03:00.000
People will give you opportunity. As simple as that.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:01.000
And I've seen that, like, this is what I'm doing, right?

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Okay, thank you.

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:10.000
I'm in the business of teaching, obviously, and especially, you know, upskilling. So, I have seen, and it's my day-to-day job, basically.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:17.000
So, this is how things work. Yep. Yeah, Namneet, please go ahead.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:18.000
Kind of neat, yeah, huh. Uh-huh.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:22.000
I should answer. So, actually, I had 3 doubts. For generative AI nowadays.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:44.000
All our big cloud, so… Can you discuss all generative AI with cloud? And also, there is another thing. So, companies using, uh, because Python is monolithic, they will work on. So, everybody is looking for is Spark, so… All projects will be there as part, because Spark will require for huge data set, so all… for in the real industry, uh, industrial, so all are for big, uh, led big data.

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:48.000
Thank you for me, John.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:54.000
So there is no… Python is not useful, so everyone is using Pya Spark.

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:58.000
First question. So, answering to your first question, with respect to a cloud.

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:07.000
So that's the… so obviously, with respect to a cloud, we'll be talking about things in agility, right? Coming to a second question, Spark, right? So basically, a Spark is a data processing engine.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
No, not, uh…

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:22.000
Sandeep, please go on mute, yeah. So, basically, see, as far as Spark is concerned, so Spark is a data processing engine, and obviously Spark gives you a leverage in four languages, Java, Scala, Python, and R.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:31.000
That's completely fine. Now, uh, people are using a Spark framework, or PI Spark, not Python. It's not true at all.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:43.000
Espad gives you a leverage, obviously, with respect to a huge amount of a data processing, but data processing, at the end of the day, is one of the unit. And that can be, again, done case by case in a different, different manner.

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:52.000
So it's not like 100% people are going to use just a Python, just a Spark. No, there is no dominance of one single ticket stack in any of the industry.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:05:09.000
You will be able to find out enough use cases with respect to PI Spark. You will be able to find out enough use cases, even with respect to a core Python, where no Spark engine is being used. For example, if I'm writing an EFL kind of a statement, if I'm writing a simple logic, if I'm writing an algorithm, I don't have to, like, write everything into a PySpark.

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:20.000
Right? Unnecessarily, I don't have to be involved. So, I would say, Spark is also relevant, Python is also relevant. If you know Python, you will be able to write code into a Spark.

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:25.000
The very little amount of her syntax is going to change, uh, especially a Spark session.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:32.000
The place that you create. Apart from that, it's more like a Pandas library, Python Pandas library, where you will be able to convert your code.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:41.000
And it will just give you advantages, leverages in terms of speed, basically, because this is what a Spark Engine does. A traditional compiler does in between.

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:48.000
Now, uh, but just as Spark is, uh, like, just as Spark is going to be relevant, Python is not.

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:55.000
Again, not true. So, both will be having, uh, like, equal users, I would say, in a market.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:06:00.000
But, uh, if you… if there is a project, uh, can you provide all projects in Spark only, or in…

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:09.000
Not at all, not possible. So, basically, the Yuri API, even the URI that we are using, so we have written the complete backend in a Python itself, and it's working. A thousand people are able to use it.

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:10.000
But the problem is companies are looking for FYI spark only, so because if you go in and interview, nah.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:20.000
And they're doing an optimized manner. Who… no, no, no, no, no. See, maybe, maybe your company, it's a case-by-case, this is what I have mentioned, right? So, it's a case-by-case, so now you will say that, okay, fine.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
All MNC, all MNC, big MNC, everyone, uh, their requirement is by as far.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:34.000
I'm not certain. I'm… I'm coming from the same MNC, and again, the batch that you have, the group that you have joined, right? So, go ahead and ask how many people are using it, because the majority of them are from MNCs, and probably based on MNs.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:38.000
But I'm trying to enter Vivna, so everyone, uh, their requirement is FireSpark and Python.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:39.000
Maybe you have… you have mentioned… you have… you have mentioned big data into your resume, ma'am. Maybe you have mentioned that keyword.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:47.000
What are requirements. No, I didn't mention big data, but the requirement is Hadoop, as part, every company, their requirement is there.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:53.000
Um, I will say not a generic one, and if you would like to learn a Spark, I have a big data.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
For you?

02:06:55.000 --> 02:07:00.000
So, that course is there, but in that RDD part and all other part is not there. That RDD and… so, Spark also, it is a combination of SQL and all.

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:07.000
Fine… That will be uploaded. That will be uploaded.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:15.000
Yeah? Plus, the live batches which I have already taken in terms of a big data. Over there, again, I have discussed Spark.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:22.000
Yeah, so again, it's a case-by-case. I'll answer that one thumb rule, and you are going to apply on everything, so it's not like that.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:23.000
Basically. No, no, let's let Navneet complete his question. Yeah, Navneet, please go ahead.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:32.000
Sorry to interrupt you, yeah, I'm…

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:35.000
Okay, thanks, Namdeep. Yeah, now, Hemant, please go ahead. Yep.

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:41.000
First of all, thank you. Uh, there are 3 questions that I want to ask. Number one.

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:42.000
Uh, this course name is Bootcamp. Okay, and usually the mindset is.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:46.000
Mm-hmm. Hmm.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:50.000
The bootcamps is just the initial, uh… framework that'll be shared, right?

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:51.000
No, I know, I understand, but… By bootcamp, I understand live.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:08:01.000
So, are we going to… Okay, so are we… so are we going to… go deep dive into all the concepts that are related with Jennai.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:05.000
A lot of deep dive, more than that, I would say.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:10.000
Okay, so that is… and we have another course, uh, that's already there in the Euron platform, that is Gen AI Roadmap.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:19.000
Will that be, uh, intersecting with the bootcamp? I mean, if we go through that course.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:20.000
During the weekdays. Will that help us, uh… in learning in men.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:29.000
Yeah? Mm-hmm. See, yeah, it will help you out in terms of, like, exploring a couple of more topics, I would say.

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:40.000
Uh, plus, there are some people, because, see, uh, we are Edutech, right? So, we keep on getting, uh, different, different kind of a request. Some people say that, no, I just wanted to go ahead with the recording.

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Uh, because maybe I have to complete it in a fast track, and I don't have a time to join the live classes. Some people say that, no, I just love live classes, because it brings a discipline into me.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:58.000
Right? So, keeping that in our mind, we have to offer almost every possible thing.

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:12.000
So, this is where your pre-recorded session, or you can say a roadmap, comes into a picture, which I'm building. Uh, some of the courses is completed, but as I said, it's running late because of whatever you can say, procrastination or laziness.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:19.000
But yeah, so… but at the end of the day, I'll always suggest you, I'll always suggest you.

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:23.000
Go with only one, right? Because, see, even we have a lot of courses in a market, if you'll go… again, there are hundreds of healthcare companies, hundreds of courses.

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:29.000
Okay.

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:38.000
Everyone is good, right? Maybe equally good. So, I never say that try to distract yourself, because that will consume a lot of your energy.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:43.000
And your thoughts. So, just go with one, at least for a couple of months.

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:47.000
And you will be in a position, believe me, you will be in a position.

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:55.000
Where you don't need me, you don't need any EduTech, you don't need anyone. You will be… sufficient enough to understand each and everything.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:10:00.000
Even if that thing is going to be new for you. So that's something which I use to, like, uh.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:11.000
Do in my classes. So, the kind of assignment I'm going to give you, the kind of a project by which I'm going to give you, it will make you capable enough.

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:12.000
Okay.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:19.000
To explore anything going forward on your own. You can't keep on learning something, right? You can't, like, uh… you must be… get into a position where you will be able to understand each and everything on your own.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:22.000
Yeah, maybe not now, maybe after a year, right? And that's my job to do it.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:28.000
So, this is how the classes will be conducted, and I never say that keep too much of distraction. Only one at a time.

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:31.000
Okay. Okay. Uh, my second question is, uh. Partially it was answered in the earlier conversations.

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:34.000
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:38.000
Uh, it was regarding the… connection to our own knowledge base.

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:41.000
Mm-hmm.

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:48.000
Now, what are the knowledge bases that we are going to cover in this course? So, for example.

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:49.000
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:54.000
I mean, the organization that I'm working in. Uh, there is another team, otherwise, who is actually working on integration with the… with the sales data that is coming from Salesforce.

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:02.000
To build the RFPs and so on. So what I wanted to, uh, understand is.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:08.000
In this particular course, are we going to use any sample knowledge base?

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:12.000
To integrate with the general… the LLMs. Because those are the use cases that are being driven in the industry.

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:19.000
Okay, let me show it to you. Uh, is Antique Lang Chain, where is my ROG? Yeah.

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:24.000
So…

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:28.000
Him. Yes?

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
Okay? So, uh, that… so… hmm?

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:37.000
So basically, we are going to integrate our Euron knowledge base over here, and eventually you will be able to integrate any other.

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:44.000
Okay, so if you're able to integrate even one of the knowledge bases.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:45.000
Yes. Your data is going to change. Only data is going to change, nothing much.

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:54.000
The thought process, or the framework still remains the same. And when we're going to… and when we're… Correct, correct. And when we are going to do that, uh, are we talking about both the unstructured.

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:55.000
And the structured?

02:11:55.000 --> 02:12:03.000
Uh, yes, so mostly, I will be dealing with the unstructured one, complete unstructured one, because if you can handle unstructured, you can handle anything.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:08.000
Okay, because today, uh. The organization data.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:09.000
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:15.000
They are actually… okay, unstructured data is there. Informal document and so on, but most of the data is available in the structured form.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:16.000
And that is wherein they're actually used… Okay.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:29.000
It's actually very easy to handle a structured one. Right? So, that's the reasons why I generally like to focus on the unstructured one, and I keep on saying that if you can handle unstructured, then structure is nothing, it's a table, right? So, just a table. We have been processing it.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:33.000
Since, uh, four or five decades, since the SQL kind of a system exists.

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:34.000
I agree. Uh, yeah, the integration may be… may differ. But what I wanted to understand is.

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:39.000
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:44.000
Both of these, uh, will be covered. Under part of this, uh, peric column.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:47.000
Yeah, here, yes. It's already covered. Yep, yep. Any other question, Heman?

02:12:47.000 --> 02:13:05.000
Okay, great. Yep. Uh, no, I think that's pretty… I very much look forward to this. I've been waiting for this for quite a while.

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:06.000
Okay.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:13.000
Just focus on one. Believe me, just focus on one, at least for 3 to 4 months, with dedication. Try to spend a time, enough amount of time, because you need that much of time going forward. The way we are going to conduct these classes, the way you will be able to get a coursework and project work, right? So, you have to invest a time.

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:18.000
But after that, I don't think that anyone has to, like, join any of the classes, not even mine.

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
Okay, and Sudanjiji, just one last question. My current role is in Enterprise Architect.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:28.000
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:29.000
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:34.000
So, uh, from the architecture point of view. We're just not… I mean, we need… we need to look at the development. That is one aspect. But there are a lot of other aspects, right?

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:37.000
The security, the infrastructure, and all of those things. Do we really cover those aspects in this course?

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:58.000
Mm-hmm. With respect to modern infra, with respect to GPU, I will be covering in this project, because we are going to use two kind of a model. One is a proprietary model, so which you will be able to call it with respect to API. For example, you have to integrate ChatGPT, right? So, obviously, ChatGPT is a proprietary model. You will not be able to download it.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:13.000
So, obviously, you have to call the API. That integration will be done. The second kind of a model, for example, a Llama, or maybe a Maverick, this kind of a model. So, obviously, this kind of a model is an open source model, which, even inside the URI, you will be able to go, and you will be able to see.

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:20.000
That we have given the access of our proprietary, like a GPTs and, like, a DeepSeek or Llama, so these are the open source model. You can go ahead and you can download it from the.

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:34.000
Hugging Face, or maybe from a Ulama. Now, so when you are talking about this open source model, and when you have to do an inferencing with respect to this model, you have to host this model by creating your own infrastructure on a GPUs.

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:59.000
Then only you will be able to do inferencing, right? Then only thousands of people together will be able to do inferencing, right? And that, too, on a scale. So, obviously, at that point of a time, you need a proper infra setup. Without proper infra setup, you can't build this kind of a project, right? And not just infrastructure, I would say, even a routing you have to build over here, you have to do a domain mapping, so end-to-end, because at the end of the day, you can't, like, keep a project in a local host.

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:00.000
Yeah, that's a hobby that'll be turning out to be a hobby project otherwise.

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:05.000
That will not be called as a real-time project. Plus, a lot… Another hobby project, right? I don't believe in that part, basically. So, and again, so that's the reason. So, in a syllabus.

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:08.000
Yes, okay.

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:18.000
I keep on mentioning a real-time project, and this time, for this particular batch, I have mentioned this project, which is live, which people are using it since day zero, but we will end up creating that in a class as well.

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:22.000
Okay, so it's really useful to know that it's a deployable solution.

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:23.000
Deployable.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:43.000
Exactly, and that too… that too, with respect to Gen AI, right? So, deployable solution-wise, it's completely fine, like, we can show our deployment just with respect to Elastic being a stack, or maybe just by using a render cloud, a streamlined cloud, where there will be only one-click deployment, right? Just, like, push your code into a GitHub, and then from there, one click, deploy it, or maybe con- convert that things into a Docker, and then deploy it.

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:50.000
But that is not how real-time deployment happens, right? We create a proper CI-CD pipelines and things will go.

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:57.000
Club looked in, and then, uh, like, it will go through a complete testing pipeline, so from development to a testing to a production.

02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:03.000
And, like, we have to follow the proper channel for that one, and that is something which we will be doing here, in this project especially.

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:07.000
So do we also consider the feedback mechanism from the users? I'm trying to address the hallucination.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:15.000
Um, as a part of this… as a part of this project, like, feedback will come from the student, or maybe you can ask someone to use your project, they will give it to you.

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:20.000
Okay. Okay, okay, when I say feedback, so for example, if I deploy any solution, I mean, right now we're talking about GenAI.

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:27.000
Yeah. Yeah. Hmm.

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:28.000
Hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:33.000
But when we deploy a solution to the end user, we need to… develop a next round of features, right? And that usually comes from the feedback.

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:34.000
Hmm, hmm.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:39.000
Mechanism. Uh, what I wanted to understand is. Do we… do we cover… Uh, on how…

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:49.000
Well, see, it depends upon… it depends upon your user, right? For me, basically, whenever I build something, for example, I was building UD API, right? So, initially, I have given only, like, a 12 model access, a simple input example.

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
Correct. I… I… Yes, I… mhm.

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:54.000
Then people… then my student has given a feedback. In a multiple group.

02:16:54.000 --> 02:17:02.000
Correct. I understood from that perspective. There were… there were a lot of feedbacks that were being incorporated in the solution itself.

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:03.000
And that is how we will improvise, yeah.

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:09.000
Exactly. So we have… Exactly. So we have built that feature, simple. So, if you will look like a video, 3 or 4 months back, right? This menu option was not available, actually.

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:12.000
Okay. Okay.

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:16.000
People have… people have given us a feedback. We have done the implementation.

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
Okay.

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:29.000
Right? So obviously, like, every product development happens in that way. On days zero, you start with the MVPs or simple POCs, and then eventually you grow… your customer base will grow, and they will keep on giving you a bad or good feedback.

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:35.000
Constructive or destructive one, and then eventually improvise. Uh, maybe product lifecycle follows the same thing.

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
Yes. Okay, Sudanjiri, uh, thank you so much. I very much look forward to this.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:42.000
Yeah, yep. Thank you, yeah. Ranjit, please go ahead.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
Yeah, can you hear me? Yeah, yeah, number one, thank you very much for putting this course.

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:50.000
Yeah, I can hear you, Ranjit. Yeah, please go ahead.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:51.000
You know, they're Megan.

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:57.000
And hope you're enjoying, everyone, and hope Ranjit and everyone is enjoying the conversation. I think we are having a very good conversation, very productive one.

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
Uh… Yeah.

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:08.000
Yeah, okay, I love you, because, uh… Yeah, yeah, I love… I love you, because you're see the first course.

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
I have ever taken in 30 years of my… career, IT career.

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:13.000
Boom! Thank you so much, thank you so much. You are… you are, like, very senior to me. Thank you so much, sir, for being here.

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:21.000
So, I'm almost 70 years old. Yeah, uh, yeah, almost 70 years old.

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:22.000
Okay. Now, actually, for the past 2 years, I have not been working.

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:26.000
Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay.

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
Okay, I'm retired. But, uh, now, uh, then I started.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:31.000
Okay.

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:37.000
Are you on a website, and then I… it's taking you… started taking your classes, and now.

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:44.000
Basically, I feel like maybe going back to do something worthwhile.

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:45.000
Mm-hmm.

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:51.000
Okay, but I have got a few questions for you. One is… I think I asked you also WhatsApp, Katie, about VLM.

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:52.000
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:58.000
That is, vegan language model. Do we have any example of a VLM.

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:10.000
Use case in your own platform, or can you create one if we don't have?

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:11.000
Yes.

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:24.000
Uh, yes, actually, uh, same question. Yeah, it was you who have asked me, right? Uh, I remember, yes, yes, yeah, now I remember your name, sir. So… so… Uh, we have not any use cases, so when you have asked me yesterday, which I remember the conversation, so basically, I have asked my team.

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:35.000
To release one model, so where in this Yuri API itself, you will be able to call a VLM, basically. So, my team said that, okay, fine, so by next week.

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:44.000
Uh, we are going to release the API, and once API will be released, I'll create a small POC for you, and please remind me, because of a lot of, like, engagement, right? So I, uh, like, keep on, like, forgetting things.

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:48.000
Hm. Hm.

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:59.000
So, just reminding me, once I'm going to release the API, and uh… again, so I will be able to create, and similarly, hundreds of people will be able to create. I've already asked my team to release the API for that.

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:04.000
It's a very good, because what I see is that in LLM.

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:24.000
You can use only your text. But when it comes to VL.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:25.000
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:39.000
None of those, not at all, not at all. So, see, uh, if you will look here, uh, is DK, not SDK, I'll say… Uh, endpoint, right? So, text, that's completely fine. We are using, even for embeddings. Embeddings means converting any kind of a textual information into a numerical space, right? So, we are going to use our LLMs over here. So, here we have given you OpenAI model itself. Now, text-to-speech, TTS.

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:40.000
Mm-hmm.

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:49.000
Again, we are using it, right. Uh, image generation, again, so there are so many… for streaming. So even for a streaming, we have already built the endpoint. Very soon, we are going to use it, and as you have asked, a VLM, right? So even for a VLM, so you will be able to see an endpoint over here. So we are going… I think, yeah, yesterday after that discussion in a group, I have asked my team.

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:50.000
Okay.

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:57.000
I think I have already also pinged, right? Uh, if I remember correctly, like, uh, in a group itself, that I've asked my team, and they said that they are going to do it.

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:58.000
I think I have picked back. Okay. Mm-hmm.

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:07.000
Okay, maybe I didn't check that, but one question. Now, since you said that, this can also be used as a part of VLM, in case. Now, the question to you is that.

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:10.000
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:17.000
From VLM, I mean that there is an image, and there are questions and answers based on… upon the image.

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:18.000
So, question and answer, because there is some kind of information.

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:22.000
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:23.000
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:28.000
Which can we… would run only from the image, because there are some questions written into that. And then you can find answers based on that.

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:32.000
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:37.000
So, we will be scenarios which you're showing here, uh, generator embedding, or text-to-speech.

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:40.000
That too…

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:43.000
Will this be able to find those answers.

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:52.000
Exactly, sir, this is what the VLM is, right? So VLM simply means that you try to give two kind of an input. One input will be your image, right? And the second input is going to be your question.

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:53.000
So that system will be able to understand your image, and then it will try to give you the answer. That is something technically called as VLM.

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:59.000
Yes.

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:10.000
Right? So, the API endpoint that we are going to release, you will be able to pass two parameters, basically, right? One parameter is your image, any kind of an image that you want, you will be able to pass, and then on top of that, you will be able to pass your question.

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:15.000
And eventually, you will be able to, like, chat with your image.

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:16.000
So that is, that is something that, for that, we are going to lease the API endpoint.

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:20.000
Okay. Good. Okay, yeah, yeah, thank you very much for this answer. There is another question I have, because.

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:25.000
Oh, Mia. Mm-hmm.

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:30.000
You see, there are lots of use cases which were used for machine learning, and from that now.

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:37.000
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:38.000
Welcome, welcome.

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:45.000
Uh, since now LLM. Has taken over. I want to know if you can provide some kind of a… maybe either write-up or not write-up, then some kind of a lecture based on that.

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:50.000
What do those use cases which were used before for ML.

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:58.000
Now, better can be handled with. Llm.

02:22:58.000 --> 02:22:59.000
I see. Yes.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:04.000
Mm-hmm. Lot of use cases, a lot of use cases. It means literally a lot of use cases. I can try to provide you, and even during a classes, that is going to happen, but I think I was answering someone else's question, and someone has asked me that, what is the use case?

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
Yes.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:09.000
I think recommender system, we all know, right? So everywhere, whether we go to a Netflix, whether we go to Amazon, whether we go to any shopping website, right?

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:17.000
Yes, yes.

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:18.000
Mm-hmm.

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:26.000
So everywhere, people are using recommended system, yeah? Now, people… so initially, so two decades back, when they have built the recommender system, it was a rule-based, basically. So if this is going to happen, if user is going to do this.

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:27.000
Then do this, this kind of a system, right? Purely rule-based system.

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
Hmm.

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:40.000
Then, 10-year backs, or 8-year bags, so we have started building that kind of a system with the help of ML model. So, where we try to use the classification model, or we try to use, basically, uh, maybe a distance mapping model.

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:41.000
Right? Or maybe a clustering model. So we try to put the user data into a different, different cluster.

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:44.000
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Hmm.

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:56.000
Although maybe I came in clustering kind of approach, or maybe higher clustering kind of approach, we were trying to use, and then we were trying to cluster the user, and then doing a mapping with the product, and eventually it was a recommended system, right? Then, one step forward, five years or six years back, you can say, when deep learning was evolving.

02:23:56.000 --> 02:24:02.000
Mm-hmm, yes.

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:08.000
So, we have started solving the same problem with the help of neural network, because neural network can understand a more complex user data in a better way, right?

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:11.000
Mm-hmm. Hmm, mhm. Mm-hmm.

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:15.000
Now we are into LLMs. And we all know the recommended system, right, sir?

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:16.000
Yes, yes, yes, yes, of course.

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:26.000
Yeah? So, yeah, so now the complete phase has changed, now we are using LLMs, because at the end of the day, to build our recommended system, I have to understand my user and my product. Two things. And then I have to do a mapping.

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm.

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:34.000
This is something called as, in a layman manner, if I have to talk about a recommended system, what is that, right? So, you have to map the product with the user interest.

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:35.000
Mm-hmm.

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:53.000
In the best possible way, right? Now, to understand the user interest, obviously, I have to know the user location, what user is doing at what point of a time, what is the user clicks, basically, or which point user is stopping, for how long this user is looking at that particular asset, or maybe that particular tab, or something like that, right?

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:54.000
So how soon user is going to do a checkout? I have to analyze all of this data. Now.

02:24:54.000 --> 02:25:00.000
Mm-hmm.

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:01.000
Yes. Yes.

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:07.000
Who can understand better than LLMs nowadays? Yeah, so recommended system, we are using a lot of LLMs, and even inside our Euron, so we have built our latest equipment system in that way.

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:19.000
That is just one of the use cases. Now, so we have been using our support system, maybe it's an audio-video-based support system, or maybe it was just a chat-based support system.

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:28.000
So, where, uh, even, like, a 5 or 6 years back, I remember, and even I have worked in a lot of such kind of project, so where we have started building a chat solution.

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:32.000
And if you remember IBM Watson, right? I think everyone heard about IBM Watson?

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:50.000
Yeah? A kind of a chat agent, or kind of a chat solution, which was released 10 years back, right? And people have been using it, and across the industry, everyone has adopted it. So, at that point of a time, we have used our simple NLP model, and we have passed our own data. We have trained it so that it was… it will be able to answer.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:56.000
Now, no one is even using it. Everywhere it's LLMs. Right? So we are treating our LLMs, we are fine-tuning our LLMs.

02:25:56.000 --> 02:26:06.000
So, everywhere, where we were using, uh, AI, majority of times, it's a LLMs, visual LLMs, let's suppose, VLMs, right? Let's talk about that.

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:19.000
So, yes, we have been using object detection, we have been doing our object segmentation, we have been even doing, uh… Object tracking. Now, VLM can do it in a better way. Vlm can detect an object in a better way.

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:23.000
Right? We have been building a lot of classification models in computer vision, in deep learning, in machine learning.

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:24.000
Right? Now, we are not even doing it. Llms can do it in a better way.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:28.000
Mm-hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm.

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:37.000
Right? So, things has literally changed, and uh, yes, obviously LLMs is replacing it, and technically, it's a… you can say.

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:43.000
Modern day of automation, we are trying to achieve it with the help of LLMs. I'm not saying that automation was not there, it was there. Even two decades back.

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:51.000
But yeah, now it's a, like, uh, intervention of LLMs, and with the help of that, we are trying to.

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:52.000
Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah, thank you.

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:59.000
Basically modify a whole system. So technically, we are in a phase, technically, I would say we are in a phase, where literally we are rewriting all the systems.

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:06.000
That has existed last 2-3 decades.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:07.000
Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:13.000
Mm-hmm. No, no, thank you for providing this clarity, but there is one question now. For example, for example, AWS. Aws has lots of, uh.

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:26.000
Uh, services that deal with the chat, basically, Poly, Alexa, and there is… they have the, uh… personalization, and they have. So, all those technologies can be replaced with LLM, that means?

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:32.000
Already done certain, already done. Did Rajad exists, now they are not selling Alexa, nobody's even using it.

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:41.000
But I see that there are still. Lots of openings for those kind of chat boards, which are not even, uh.

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:42.000
Should not be there, because LLM. Mm-hmm.

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:50.000
There, they're… so… so… No, no, no, so because they have to revamp the system, right? So… Like I said, we are rewriting the entire IT infra, technically.

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:51.000
We are rewriting the… we are rewriting everything that we have written in last 2-3 decade.

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:55.000
Mm-hmm.

02:27:55.000 --> 02:28:06.000
Now, with the betterment, with the advancement. So, everywhere… that's the reason, so there are so many… so much of opportunity, you will be able to see for a generative AI, or for anyone who understands even the previous technology.

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:12.000
Right? Because to rewrite, you have to understand the previous one as well, right? You can't just go ahead and overnightly replace everything.

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:17.000
So, there is opportunity, obviously. There will be an opportunity, uh, for a very, very long time.

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:20.000
Because we have to remap everything.

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:30.000
So, that means that we are on the right track. If we go and master this, uh, generative AI LLMs and all those… Of course, that's the best. Yeah.

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:41.000
Just as builds are simple. My approach is to, like, build something, like, write a code, build something, break something, right?

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:42.000
Mm-hmm, okay. Yeah. No, thank you.

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:46.000
Um, I don't believe much in learning. So, yeah. We'll do a lot of things. We'll build a lot of things.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:47.000
Thank you very much. I have no more question at this time, yeah.

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:48.000
Thank you so much. Pleasure to have you in a badge.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:51.000
You know…

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:52.000
Right.

02:28:52.000 --> 02:29:00.000
Thank you. Okay, I'll take a name. I'll take a name. So, next one is, uh, Sariq, please go ahead. Yeah, Sarik.

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:01.000
Yes, I agree.

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:11.000
Yeah, sir. Sharik is here. Sir, my question… my first question is that, uh, is it required after completion of the full-stack data science course, and after that course completion.

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
We have to do this Gen AI course. Is it required?

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:23.000
Not at all. Just focus on one. Every course is a complete one in itself, right, for whatever purpose I have created. So, and I'll not recommend to go ahead with 2 or 3 at a time, only one. One means literally one.

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:26.000
Okay, so this JNI is sufficient to get a job, is it?

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:33.000
Yeah, any… anyone is, like, aligned in that way. Any batches which I use to launch, right? So every batch is having its own purpose.

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:42.000
And it will be fulfilled in that itself, so for… to do that, I will not say that go ahead and explore this or that, or that badges. No, because I know that creates a distraction.

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:43.000
Right? And we should not, we should not do that.

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:52.000
Okay, okay. Got it, got it. And next question is that, which job role should I apply, uh, to this?

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:53.000
Let's… let's go through a, uh, like, this one, at least for, uh, like, a 2-3 month lecture.

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:57.000
Are…

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:58.000
I'll come to the project part, I'll come to then resume a part, right?

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:01.000
Okay, okay, please. Okay.

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:09.000
And then I will be the one who will be guiding you for that.

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:10.000
Mm-hmm.

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:19.000
Okay, so I have enrolled in your platform, like, for internship, so how do I showcase my… actually, I was… I started a startup for 3 years back, and after that, I decided to come in the industry.

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:20.000
Mm-hmm.

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:27.000
So, uh, how do I showcase that work or anything else in this domain?

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:28.000
So just a moment.

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:37.000
So, just go ahead, pick the project, uh, in whatever domain that you want, because you have an option to filter out with respect to a domain. If that domain project is not available, you can come and request for that project. Team will take it.

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:42.000
No, no, it's available related to Gen AI. There are numerous projects there.

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:46.000
Then simple, start working on that project, maybe alone, maybe together.

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:56.000
Okay, so inside interview, when they asked me, then they will ask me how did you do, or how did you implement these.

02:30:56.000 --> 02:31:03.000
Things in your previous projects, so how… how to cope up with that?

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:08.000
Yeah, yes, yes, of course.

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:09.000
Okay.

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:15.000
In terms of showing experience, you're talking about, right? Symbols just try to mention with the honesty that, okay, fine, so I have done this internship, this was this kind of an internship where I have actually worked, because, see, if you're able to justify your work, right.

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:16.000
Uh, everyone is going to accept it, right? Everyone is going to accept it, so just whatever you have done.

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:20.000
Okay. Okay.

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:24.000
Just talk about it, right? Simple. In the exact similar manner, with no modification.

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:33.000
They won't verify these things to the previous company, like, I was a startuping company, so they did not call and.

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:36.000
Say that you did not work, or something else.

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:48.000
Let's say a company does a BGV, so most of the company, especially if I'll talk about the MNCs and product-based companies, they will do a BGVs, and uh… and uh, yeah, startup, so mostly they will not do the WCV.

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:49.000
Okay, so the startup will be the right choice for me.

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:58.000
So, accordingly, you can try to apply. Right choice, actually, for you, even work-wise, I would say, and as you are starting in your career, so I would say, uh, try to work in a startup, at least for.

02:31:58.000 --> 02:31:59.000
One year? Yep.

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:07.000
And my last question is that you have the Abni, like, things, like, uh.

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:13.000
Uh, they bought or something else, live interview mode, something like that.

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:14.000
So, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, is it, is it in a process, or…?

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:18.000
That Avani… Avani was there, yeah, Avani.

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:24.000
Yeah, so basically, we are, like, updating the Avni, so soon I'll make an announcement that Avni is back.

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:29.000
Okay, okay, okay. Thanks. I'm extremely waiting for that.

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:44.000
Yeah, so Avni, like, we are doing a revamp, so that… because last time, it was, uh, like, uh, not that great product, uh, it was cracking in between, while… because it's a real-time conversational product, right, that we have created.

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:50.000
Uh, so it was cracking a lot in between, so we have fixed it. Almost work is done, I believe.

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:55.000
In couple of weeks, you can expect. Team is, like, uh, team is doing a final testing for Avni.

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
Well, yeah, you're told about this. That product is really a revolutionary product.

02:32:57.000 --> 02:33:07.000
Yeah, yeah. So, just wait a couple of weeks. Yeah, and this time, this time you will not feel a hiccups, believe me. We have fixed everything.

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:14.000
This time, it's as smooth as, like, me and you, uh, talking to each other.

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:18.000
Yeah, thank you. Okay, so, uh, Ganesh, please go ahead. Hi, please go ahead. Yeah.

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:27.000
Yeah, actually. Uh, I have more than, uh. 10 years of experience in Java cloud technology.

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:28.000
Mm-hmm.

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:38.000
Oh, just why I joined this course. So, is there any bucket, like, for 13, 14 years of experience? What are the things that you should know to that we can create the interview?

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
And we can start that one, because there are big data.

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:44.000
Then AIE, and a lot of things in this, uh, AI, right?

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:49.000
So, which one… is there any bucket that we can, uh, basically follow?

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:50.000
To break the job.

02:33:50.000 --> 02:34:08.000
Uh, yes, sir, yeah. So basically, see, I'll tell you one thing. With a 13-year experience, because as you are going to join as a manager, or… I would say, but on a tech side, the tech side, as an architect, you are going to join, right? So, mostly, see, you have to focus on this Gen AI or Bata, whatever, that's completely fine, but apart from that.

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:21.000
The end-to-end complete system design. And what… because as an architect, from a day zero, so when you receive a project from your client, or when you will start building your own product for your team, along with your team.

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:29.000
So, as an architect, what do you do? So you try to do a lot of discussion with your stakeholder. Then, the second step is, so you try to identify the complete technology stack.

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:47.000
Because there are, like, hundreds of technologies there, right? But in your project, you will not be using all. In your project, as an architect, you are the one who is going to decide that, okay, fine, cloud-wise, I'll be using this. Service-wise, I will be using this. Llm-wise, I will be using this. Or maybe GPU host-wise, I will be using this. So there are, like, again, to build one single platform.

02:34:47.000 --> 02:35:01.000
We use our hundreds of services. So, as an architect, you are going to decide it. Then, you are going to club combine and design it, right? That, okay, fine, so catching-wise, this is something which I'm going to use. A DB-wise, which is something I'm going to use. Again, based on your experience and expertise.

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:07.000
And based on the product that you are building for an end user, based on the latency that you are expecting for your end user.

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:16.000
Right? So, I will say that try to focus more on more around this one, because as an architect, this will be required. Now, how you can do it?

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:19.000
How you will be able to gain such kind of a knowledge.

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:28.000
The real way of gaining such kind of knowledge is to build something on your own, at least 2 to 3 end-to-end product.

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:35.000
Not, like, a full-scale product, MVP-wise product, but yeah, you have to build it. Maybe a small one, but a useful one.

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:46.000
Simple. Because when you build one product, right, believe me, you face a lot of hiccup, a lot of hiccup in between, and again, so whether this product is small or big, you will end up using all those hundreds of services.

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:51.000
Right? So, that is the only approach I use to suggest to our people.

02:35:51.000 --> 02:36:01.000
And in between, you learn a lot. Right? So, there is a learning where we learn just maybe, like, a… ABCD kind of things? Right.

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:06.000
But after that, how to use and what kind of a word formation I will be able to do.

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:14.000
That you have to explore on your own, and that always comes from the experience. More you will do, more you will be able to get, and I believe 3 to 4 months is more than enough for that one.

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:18.000
Right? And, uh, again, in this batch, the project which I have mentioned.

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:26.000
It will give you ultimate, that kind of experience and expertise. See, I never believe in that, uh, like, uh.

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:30.000
Uh, even if you're a junior, you should not be knowing something which is real.

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:39.000
So, I believe that everyone should know, because we all are mature enough now, we all have that ages, maybe some of us have, like, one year of experience, some of us have 20 years of experience, but yeah.

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:44.000
I always believed that we all can understand each and everything, so keeping that in our mind.

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
It's for everyone, including user.

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:52.000
Yeah, so… Yeah, so do we also start learning on that big data.

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:53.000
The data sign. All of us.

02:36:53.000 --> 02:37:07.000
No, not at all. At the time, one, only one. See, there are a lot to learn in a market, right? And people will keep on guiding you, or maybe distracting you, that, okay, do this, do that. But as a human being, we have a limited time, we have a limited energy, we have a limited capacity.

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:12.000
And more things we explore, we get confused. So I never suggest one way, uh, that approach.

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:18.000
Just one at a time, and then try to leverage it as an opportunity, as a job.

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:19.000
Yeah, thank you, Sudan.

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:26.000
Yeah, yeah, thanks. Keisa, please go ahead.

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:27.000
Thank you.

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:35.000
Yeah, hi, thank you for the insight you shared today. So, with my background and 3 years of experience, so I'm interested in understanding how to best approach the generative AI code.

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:42.000
Like, could you recommend, uh, where I should start, or any… foundational topics I should focus on to leverage my experiences.

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:51.000
I think you're… I'm not clear with your, like, question. It was cracking in between. Can you please repeat once again?

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:52.000
Yeah, Kesha? Yeah. Please go ahead, yeah.

02:37:52.000 --> 02:38:00.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, is it okay now, yeah. So, uh, what is the best way, best approach to, for this candidate to a course? Like, could you recommend where I should start, uh, in the foundation?

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:05.000
Nothing, nothing, nothing. Just, just join the live classes. That's the reason, so I'm taking live classes, right?

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:06.000
Okay, okay. Cool.

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:13.000
So don't worry, just join the live classes. I don't keep any kind of a, like, a hardbound or prerequisite, like, a lot of prerequisites that do this, do that, no.

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:21.000
Just join the live classes with discipline, with consistency. That's the only requirement, yeah.

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:26.000
Okay, so, uh, Mahindra, please go ahead with your question.

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:36.000
You know, so I remember we had… We have a discussion on phone, so I just have one question, like, I have around… 14 years of experience in .NET development.

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:37.000
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:43.000
So, would you please tell me, like, how can I… upgrade myself into Gen AI.

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:46.000
Like, uh, area. So, what I need to learn extra?

02:38:46.000 --> 02:39:03.000
Just join, join this lesson. Nothing, nothing, nothing. And I'm covering everything, yeah? Just join it, and whatever task which I'm going to give you, whatever project work which I'm going to give you.

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:04.000
Your .NET… .NET plus, uh. Azure.

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:18.000
So maybe, like, together with your batchmates, and maybe alone, try to do that. You are already coming from a programming background, right? Maybe a .NET, but that's… Well, I mean… That's more than enough, right? So you are basically, from a tech background, so you will not face much of difficulty. You just have to, like, change the mode. Your .NET Azure mode to, like, a GenAI mode, and we'll do it.

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.000
Yeah, but apart from that, nothing.

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:25.000
One more thing, uh, like, I'm coming from the insurance domain, so I was searching in the project list, it was not there.

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:28.000
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:33.000
So I requested for that as well, so… how much time it's normally.

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:34.000
Insurance, right? In S-U-R-A.

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:47.000
Take… yeah, insurance.

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:52.000
Uh, okay, so you have already… you have already submitted your request, right?

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:53.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:39:53.000 --> 02:40:07.000
Then… then not an issue. Team will do it. Approximately, they take 2 weeks or 3 weeks of time, because they have to create a PRDHLD, LLD, and all these things, right? So, generally 2 to 3 weeks they used to take, uh, and they will upload it, if you have already requested. If not, so you can go ahead and request it.

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:08.000
And if done, then leave it to your team. They will do it their job.

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:12.000
You know…

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:13.000
Yep, yep.

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:21.000
Okay, thank you, Seth, because. That, uh, because, uh, it's hard to… transition from one technology to another technology on this.

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:22.000
Believe me, it's not a… no, no, no, it's not hard. I have seen people with a 20 year of experience.

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:27.000
Like, uh…

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:28.000
Okay, thank you, thank you very much.

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:36.000
It's, it's the easiest act… it's actually easy. And especially, like, if you're coming from the relevant background, like, tech background, so, yeah.

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:42.000
Okay, so… Thank you, Takeria. So, Somis, please go ahead.

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:50.000
Hi. Yeah, yeah, good morning, good morning.

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:51.000
Mm-hmm. Okay.

02:40:51.000 --> 02:41:00.000
Good morning. So, here, um, I'm… for my background, like, I have more than a decade in IT, but I was a Oracle developer, and uh… and recently, like, 6 to 8 months, we have started working for… in Python PySpark, okay?

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:01.000
Uh-huh, mm-hmm.

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:17.000
But… and we are actively using Copilot as well, but here the thing is, recently this API and tokenization, everything comes up in picture, and that is… by theoretically, it is quite, uh, for me, it is, um, quite difficult to understand.

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:18.000
So I can see in this Gen AI course, we have API and everything.

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:22.000
Mm-hmm.

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:33.000
And… but, um… So while going through the course, so the reason is, like, we have read theoretically, but I've not implemented, so it is… for me, it is not… I'm not able to understand.

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:34.000
Mm-hmm.

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:46.000
So, while going through the course, are we implementing what, like, are we going to know what is, uh, the API and how we are going to implement the keys and token, or we have to… go through a different course of yours to understand what it is and how to implement it.

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:56.000
No, no, no. I'm going to teach you… so, see, I completely understand that many people, even if they are aware about basic of Python, but they may be not aware about how to build an API.

02:41:56.000 --> 02:42:03.000
Right? Uh, with the help of Flask, or maybe with the help of FastAPI. So, first of all, I'm going to teach an API part as well.

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:10.000
I do know that people are coming from maybe a programming background, but many of us don't know that that's completely fine, right?

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:13.000
Uh, so I'm going to teach you that API part, plus.

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:20.000
As far as Yuri API is concerned, so I'm going to teach you that one as well. So, I think that I have already mentioned a part of syllabus. If you'll go to this one, Yuri API system.

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.000
Yes.

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:31.000
Api resume. So, I'm going to teach you that, okay, how to use this API, that API, how to use this model, that model, how to do an inferencing, basically.

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:42.000
In a Python. So everything will be done by me, uh, you don't have to worry about it. You just have to, like, do your coursework, that, okay, fine. Whatever task which I'm going to give you. Apart from that, nothing. All these things will be called by me.

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:45.000
Because it's not just your problem, it's everyone's problem, actually. So, obviously, I have to handle it.

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:49.000
Okay. Sure, sure. Thank you very much, I'm sure. I'm good.

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:53.000
Yeah, yeah, thank you, thank you. Yeah, Ramesh, please go ahead.

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:57.000
Yeah, so students, I have some question on this. So, the Python is monolithic.

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.000
Mm-hmm.

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:05.000
I'm right. So, how can we… Actually, this Janai project to Scalable.

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:08.000
Scalable or distributed patient. So, can we leverage within Spark.

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:23.000
Certainly, scalability… cell scalability and distribution doesn't come from the monolithic or microservices that we used to build. So, it comes from a lot of context. Scalability-wise, so if you're going to spawn a machine.

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:48.000
Obviously, even from there, you will be able to get a scalability, so where it is going to reduce the latency, and obviously, like, you can just, like, take a hit of 10,000 requests per second, or maybe even in a microsecond. Distribution, again, doesn't come just from that one. It comes from an SDFS kind of a system as well, right? So where you will be having a master-slave kind of architecture, where you will be having a worker node, and then you.

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:58.000
Have a name node kind of a system, and it is going to basically send a request based on the availability. So, as far as scalability and distribution, or, like, this, uh.

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:02.000
Actually, does it support this kind of genai projects lens? Landchain and land growth. We can support with the distributors.

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:15.000
Exactly, yes, yes. Yeah, so… Exactly! It does support, see, distributed system or bringing something on a scale.

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:20.000
It is an engineering problem in most of the cases, right? Not a framework problem.

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:30.000
Doesn't matter which framework you are going to use, it's the way that how we are going to configure the entire project, how I'm going to host it, how I'm going to take… how I'm going to take the request from the user.

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:40.000
Right? And then how I'm going to serve those requests to a user. So it's more like an infra problem, it's more like a, uh, I would say an engineering problem, and a configuration problem.

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:41.000
Right? So, uh, doesn't matter whether I'm using, like, a Langchen, because, see, Langchain, Llama Index, Lang Graph.

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:46.000
Okay.

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:52.000
Uh, people are using it on a scale to serve their millions of customers.

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:53.000
Mm-hmm.

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:59.000
It means I can distrib… I can create… I can just host it, or I can just convert this entire thing as a distributed system. It simply means that I can just use it for a scale.

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:00.000
Right? Even, even, even… yeah.

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:09.000
Yeah, but when we… Yeah, you know, like, when we… when we write any script in Python, it can run in the specific message, right?

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:11.000
But it cannot be distributed. And pay them.

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:27.000
No, no, no. So, this is what I'm trying to say. This is what I'm trying to say, that to which machine I'm going to send a request, that is more like a configuration that I can do, that is more like a.

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:28.000
Okay.

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:43.000
Engineering problem that I can try to solve. That, okay, so maybe I have a name node over here, and then this name node is serving the end user, I can say, and then whenever this gets a request, it is already aware about a fact that, okay, I have a 10 machine available, right, 10 machine available.

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:54.000
So, basically, this machine is available, this machine is available. So, just try to send a request over there. If this machine is busy, don't send it, right? And in every machine, there is a Python code which I'm running. Same code.

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:56.000
Okay, okay, yeah, we'll be running the same code of Agresta machine.

02:45:56.000 --> 02:46:01.000
Is that level we run the same code, exactly, right. So, whether Python is going to support it or not support it, doesn't matter.

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:10.000
I don't even bother about that, right? If it is supported, that's completely fine. If it is not, it's completely fine. I can configure my entire system in that way.

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:11.000
There's only… it's ugly.

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:18.000
Microservice, like, okay, fine. And, yeah, and, yeah, and one more reality problem, uh, church has, uh… Uh, the APA heating, right? So, APA heating is a, uh, is an expensive process.

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:22.000
Mm-hmm.

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:31.000
So, in real-time project, can we… can they download the model in local and… run the architecture, or how are they doing, performing the real-time projects?

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:32.000
Asib, uh, if you are going to download a model, so whether it's possible or not.

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:37.000
Are they going to get it?

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:48.000
Indeed, it's possible. There are hundreds of models you will be able to find out on a hugging Face or on a Ulama, so which you can download it easily, right? So, all of this model, just go to hugging.

02:46:48.000 --> 02:47:05.000
Phase, and then from here, so you will be able to download all these LLMs, or… this is one of the platforms, you can click on models, and then you have this one, right? So you have all these things, and you can download any kind of a model, not just LLMs, but even for our vision, even for our NLP, you will be able to download the model, or maybe go to the.

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:06.000
Yeah, right, but in real time, which approach would they prefer? Uh, local?

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:15.000
Ulama. Right? No, you know, coming to that point, coming to that point, right? So, again, over here, so you will be able to get the models.

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:16.000
Mm-hmm.

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:22.000
Now, if you will see the size of this model, so for example, if I'm going to talk about a deep-seq R1, 70 million parameter model.

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:23.000
Right? Now, also, what would be the size? Size is 5.2 GB, just a model size, right?

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:28.000
This…

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:29.000
Good.

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:37.000
Just the weight size is 5.2GB. Now, if I'm talking about the 671 billion parameter model, so 671, it's a 404GB.

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:38.000
Right? 404gb. Now, let's suppose if you're going to use this particular model.

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:42.000
Mm-hmm.

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:59.000
In the local system, it's near to impossible that you will download this model, and then you will be able to do an inferencing, your entire system will be choked, and even in next 24 hours, it will not be able to respond back to your query, yeah. So, if I'll talk about just 9GB model, 5.2GB model, 1.1GB model, it will work.

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:13.000
Right? It'll work. I have even created a video that how you will be able to configure your model in local with the help of Olama. So, if you'll go to your own website, your own YouTube channel, you will be able to find that. And, uh, in a very structured manner, I have discussed that particular part as well.

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:18.000
But, practically speaking, this model, I can inference in my local, which I have shown.

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:28.000
Right? Which I've already shown. But at the same point of time, this model, I can't inference in my system, although, if I'll show you my system configuration, so it's actually a heavy machine that I'm using.

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:35.000
So, here, uh, if I'm going to show you, so I have 96GB of RAM, 6TB of hard disk.

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:45.000
24 GB of a dedicated GPU, and then 48GB of a GPU, right? So, I have a heavy machine, but still, in my machine, I can't do the same thing.

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:46.000
This is straight.

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:55.000
Even though I have a 96 GB of a CPU. Right? So, basically, so you can't do it. So now, if you can't do it, you need what? You need a cloud platform.

02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:56.000
Or maybe some bare metal. Right? Maybe some…

02:48:56.000 --> 02:49:04.000
Okay, so, so, yeah, as per the pine nut, the pint will be performing the real-time project to running cloud.

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:05.000
Mostly, mostly.

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:14.000
Exactly, exactly, right? That open source model is available. If your company is having a concern that, no, I want everything in my system. Means, their cloud.

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:35.000
Not somewhere else, right? In their cloud, because they have some, like, issue with our data, that my data should not go to any, like, a GPT or, like, Cloudy or someone. Right? Though, in that case, you have to ultimately host your model on a cloud, and only from there, you will be able to do the inferencing, and you can expose it to our end user.

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:45.000
Right? This is what has been done, even here, for the open models. For these models, we are even calling, like, an API, because GPT is not open source, right? For the open source model.

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:50.000
Host it, then… giveaway inferencing to the end user.

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:54.000
Yeah, so would they also compromise with the security? Because maybe.

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:57.000
The data sent back, right, through online. More important back.

02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:12.000
There's a majority of companies having that concern, actually. Yeah, majority of companies having that kind of a… See, both the approaches are costly. Even if you're consuming an API from someone, it's not cheap. Apis are, at least for now, this year, it's not cheap. Maybe going forward, it'll be cheap, right? So, as general industry, and.

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:20.000
Plus, hosting your own model on a cloud, and especially a model like this, right, and inferencing it.

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:21.000
Mm-hmm. Go ahead.

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:31.000
Again, it's not cheap. Even on a cloud. Right? But again, so majority of companies try to, like, go ahead with this approach, because they have to do a fine-tuning, that's the first concern, maybe on their own data, right? This is what Gen AI engineer does.

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:36.000
The second one is basically, like, a security concern, that I don't want to share my data or send my data to someone else's else server.

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:37.000
Yep.

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:50.000
Yeah, so again, case to case, but yeah, there are some companies who just go and use, like, a model directly, and again, there are many people who are building their product, their startup, they're using EuroAP system, our API system.

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:53.000
Well, is there one more one system, okay?

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:57.000
It's my, like, yeah, it's a uran system.

02:50:57.000 --> 02:51:03.000
Okay, okay, sure, okay. And one more final question, can we integrate Spark with the Gen AI project, uh, Spark later application?

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:07.000
You can see a spark. Spark is just a processing framework, nothing more than that, right?

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:08.000
Nothing more than that at all, literally nothing more than that.

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:10.000
This view.

02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:19.000
So, you can integrate Spark everywhere, wherever you have to, like, do a data processing and… See, even Spark, right? People say that Spark is fast, but.

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:32.000
Let me tell you one thing. As I'm coming from the big data background, and from, like, at that time, when big data was very new, right? So, Spark is going to perform better in a distributed machine, not in your local machine.

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:33.000
That it is correct.

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:43.000
People say… people think that, okay, fine, I'm going to use a Spark, and it is going to solve all the problems. No, it is not going to solve all your life problem with respect to latency and speed, not at all.

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:51.000
Again, you have to go ahead with a distributed computation, because if you're going to run Spark in a standalone mode, it's as good as writing a plain Python code.

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:53.000
They're really impairment.

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:58.000
And, like, you will not get much of benefit. So, again, it comes from that qualification, and Spark is just a framework. You guys use it.

02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:05.000
Right? Just like any other language. Yep.

02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:07.000
Yeah, thanks. Uh, Siwam, please go ahead.

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:09.000
Yeah, sir, I am notable.

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:13.000
Yes, you are audible, loud and clear.

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:16.000
Actually, I want to join as a data-energist. I have also started learning generative AI from today.

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:20.000
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:24.000
But now I'm a little bit confused about what I should focus on more.

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:25.000
Only one at a time. I keep assessing everyone, don't do much, don't do two things at home.

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:36.000
I… Yeah. I feel like generative AI folks are not easily available for pressors, so I'm seeking your suggestion.

02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:41.000
No, it's actually available more now. So, it's actually available more, as compared to Data Analyst.

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:46.000
Data analyst is quite old, but Genitive AI, yes, it's actually available for a fresher.

02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:47.000
Should I focus on generative AIO data in this role first?

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:54.000
What are you in conditions? As you have already joined, I'll say yes. Give a time of 3-4 months just to this one.

02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:55.000
Okay, sir, thank you. Yeah, yeah.

02:52:55.000 --> 02:53:07.000
See, both are good, I'm not saying that, uh, data analytics, because I'm taking those classes as well, so obviously, I can't say that, like, data analytics is an irrelevant one, but, uh.

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:15.000
One at a time. Yeah, and if you have joined this, then go ahead with this, only.

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:23.000
Yeah, Arman, please go ahead. Yeah, Aramadan.

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:28.000
Arman, I'm audible to you. Perthius, please go ahead. Anil… yeah.

02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:29.000
Hello, sir. Sarah Madibil?

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:34.000
Yeah, Brutus, please go ahead. Yes, loud and clear. Go ahead.

02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:42.000
Yes, sir, I just entered my fourth year, and from a background perspective, I have some, uh, built some projects around Android.

02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:51.000
But I think now it's better to delve into AI. So… and sometimes I also feel that I'm lagging behind. So, sir, any guidance as a fourth year?

02:53:51.000 --> 02:54:00.000
You are even… first off, first off, yeah, first of all, see, you are too young, and I know the dilemma, I can understand the dilemma. We all have gone through that phases.

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:11.000
So, uh… You have a time to explore multiple things. I'll say, like you said, Android, and then someone may be advising you for AI.

02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:18.000
Uh, go ahead with one, as you have joined this one, so just go ahead with this. Then eventually, explore Android as well. Who is stopping you?

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:24.000
Right? And it's not late for you, believe me. It's… you are in a very, very early stage.

02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:30.000
Yes, sir. So, sir, for the next 3-4 months, will it be good to only focus on Zen A?

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:43.000
Yes, only, only. One at a time. If you're focusing on Android, don't come to Gen AI. Then just focus on one, because you have a 24-hour, right? Out of that 24-hour, you have to go… you have to sleep for 8 hours, you have to eat.

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:52.000
Right? You have to complete your daily routine, plus you have to go to your college, and you have to do everything. So, again, whatever you will do, your time will get divided from that 24 hour itself.

02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:57.000
So that's the reason focus only on one, with the. Full capacity.

02:54:57.000 --> 02:55:03.000
Yes, sir. Sir, one more question. Sir, what to expect from the job market nowadays as a fresher?

02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:09.000
Uh, see, you should not keep any kind of expectation. Job market will always give you a reward based on your skills.

02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:21.000
Simple. Yeah, yeah. Okay, Ayous, please go ahead. Nova is asking your recommendation for purchasing a laptop and desktop for a future-proof. My old system is 7-year-old.

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:24.000
Oh, Andrava, if you are upgrading your system, then go for any i9.

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:30.000
Iron with the GPU. Yep. If you're upgrading it.

02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:32.000
Yeah, I use, please go ahead, Ayos, yeah.

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:35.000
Uh, I recently started… I actually am from Nepal, so I've been following your work since the Neuron days.

02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:39.000
Mm-hmm. Thank you.

02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:44.000
So, I recently… it's been a year since I've started, uh, my job as a research AI engineer.

02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:45.000
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:53.000
In Nepal. I work in a fintech company. So basically, now, with our focus on generative AI, we're especially looking into, you know, newer.

02:55:53.000 --> 02:56:01.000
Reinforcement learning techniques, such as our LHF or RLVR. So, my first question is, will you be covering all this topic, including GRP?

02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:10.000
Our village of… I'm covering, yes. In this one, I'm covering, that one.

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:11.000
Mm-hmm.

02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:20.000
And the other question that I have is, since I work in a fintech background, all the… Uh, text generations or GPT or BERT, whatever we use. Uh, what we are majorly asked is we need a lot of reasoning models to be developed.

02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:25.000
So, will we be covering, uh, chain of thought, supervised fine-tuning, and all of that stuff here also?

02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:30.000
I'm doing, anyhow, I'm covering chain of thought, I'm covering, though, yes.

02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:31.000
Yeah. Yeah, thanks. Yeah.

02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:40.000
Okay, okay, thank you, thank you, that's all.

02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:46.000
Uh, okay, so next is who can go? Vedant Ya. Vidant, please go.

02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:55.000
Govidand, uh, next to Mohan, you can go ahead with your question, if I'm not available to do with Lant.

02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:56.000
Yeah, Mohan, please go ahead.

02:56:56.000 --> 02:57:04.000
Yeah, uh, hi. I'm coming from the data engineering background, especially in, uh.

02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:05.000
Mm-hmm.

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:13.000
From the Databricks side. So, see, recently, there is a lot of, uh, innovation from Databricks, uh, regarding Gen AI. They have.

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:18.000
I believe, you know, abstracted away a lot of difficult things, and, uh, you know.

02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:25.000
For developers like us, data engineers and all, it's easy to build, uh.

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:32.000
Things in, uh, you know, our Databricks. That's what I have understood from the demos and all.

02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:33.000
Mm-hmm.

02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:40.000
So, um… For someone with, you know, experience in, you know, big data and all.

02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:47.000
I want to add, uh, this as an extra thing into my skill set.

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:48.000
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:55.000
So, when I learn about your course, uh, do you think, like, this will be, uh, going into the, uh.

02:57:55.000 --> 02:58:03.000
Instead of abstracted things, it will be going into the lower level of details, which will give me more in-depth knowledge about.

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:09.000
Very low, actually, very low. Low means when I say low, right, it's absolute low, which we will try to touch.

02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:15.000
And then we are going to explore a new topic, not on a high level. I never believe in high level, basically.

02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:34.000
Yeah, so basically, if I learn your course. It will be easier for me to develop things in these, uh, you know, platforms, which is abstracting away all the complexities and giving you a… higher-level tools to build, uh, things in a faster, uh, uh.

02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:38.000
Rad method. So, this will be good for me only, right?

02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:45.000
Indeed, indeed, we are going to do it. We are going to develop first here itself. So, such kind of platform, right, such kind of platform, we are going to build it here.

02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:58.000
And then, obviously, as you are coming from a background where you have learned a Databricks, and around that ecosystem, and you have seen that, at least, right? Or maybe you are using it, so you will be able to develop, and you will be able to add something on top of that.

02:58:58.000 --> 02:59:05.000
So, are you going to do any project in the database, like using Genie, or Playground?

02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:11.000
I have a big data for… I have launched Big Data for Databricks for that one.

02:59:11.000 --> 02:59:12.000
See, the… See, the thing is… yeah, yes.

02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:17.000
But that is big data specific, right? But, uh, generally, when you… most of the people in…

02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:21.000
Okay, I'll tell you one thing. See, there are Databricks-like, there are other template form.

02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:22.000
Correct, yeah.

02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:40.000
Right? Again, they are trying to leverage, uh, generative AI. Right? Now, in a syllabus, practically, it's impossible to accommodate each and everything, so… whatever I have mentioned as a syllabus, I'll be covering from a very, very low level. Believe me, after that, you will be able to use it.

02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:50.000
See, at the end of the day, database plates you what? A kind of a unified interface, where you can write a code, you will be able to create a workflow, you will be able to schedule, and eventually you will be able to trigger a particular job.

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:56.000
This is what Databix does, right? Fine, whatever you are going to build.

02:59:56.000 --> 03:00:02.000
Just copy and paste the same thing over there. But class-wise, if you're going to ask me, there are hundreds of other tools and technologies.

03:00:02.000 --> 03:00:09.000
It's practically impossible for me to accommodate everyone, because everyone will come and say, okay, discuss this, discuss that, discuss this.

03:00:09.000 --> 03:00:17.000
So, again, this is going to create a lot of discussion for… distraction for me and for other people as well, right? And in that case, trust will not go anywhere.

03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:27.000
I'll try to strict myself just towards a syllabus. Explore that, and then if you're looking for some advice, apart from, like, the content and curriculum which I've mentioned.

03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:30.000
Feel free to have a discussion. I never say no to anything.

03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:44.000
Yeah. Yeah, understood. Uh, see, basically, you know, most of the people when, even in YouTube or anywhere, right, they will give the straightforward scenarios which most of the time in production, productionized system.

03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:56.000
It doesn't work like that. And most of the people, you know, exclude the cost factor, which is very, very much important for the enterprise, because each and every line that you write.

03:00:56.000 --> 03:01:13.000
Is actually costing, especially in the cloud scenario. So, most of the people nowadays, you know, who are implementing things without understanding cost factor and end of the day, many projects are not going to production because of this cost escalation, and which is being…

03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:22.000
Escalator to the vendor itself. So, the cost factor and what are the best practices, and how to…

03:01:22.000 --> 03:01:43.000
I will be talking about the optimization scalability, because this is where the major cost factor comes into picture. If we have optimized your product, uh… Till a lower label, then again, whatever cost it will give, it will give. As simple as that, right? So, I don't believe in a cost calculation, I believe in a technology selection, I believe in an infra selection, I believe in a scalability, I believe in a optimization.

03:01:43.000 --> 03:01:51.000
Simple. And then eventually, you can calculate the cost. So I don't discuss the cost part, but yeah, I do discuss about the optimization.

03:01:51.000 --> 03:02:02.000
And, uh, about, uh, once you productionize, right, the observed… observing the performance of the model.

03:02:02.000 --> 03:02:06.000
Is it, uh, you know, the… where does this.

03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:12.000
In case of… in case of LLM, in case of LLM, you don't absurd the performance, because LLM is LLM, that's fine. Uh, yeah, there is… there is something called as, like, a… So, let's suppose if you are using a Lama model, right?

03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:18.000
Accuracy, accuracy I'm talking about.

03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:28.000
Over there, what accuracy you will try to check. Yeah, that is one of the case, right? Let's suppose I'm talking about second case. Yes, RAG. So, where we are trying to give our own knowledge base.

03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:38.000
And with that, we are trying to tune and we are trying to train it. So for RAG, so obviously, the time you are going to build the ROG system, you will try to build an evaluation mechanism as well. So that evaluation mechanism will work while building it.

03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:49.000
And even in a production, so you have to apply the same thing. Third part is, so let's suppose I have fine-tuned my model. So again, over there, so you will try to do a pre-evaluation, and then even, like, a post-evaluation, uh, you are going to do.

03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:55.000
So, yes, we do apply, and that's a very normal thing that we do everywhere in the model.

03:02:55.000 --> 03:03:06.000
And, uh, nowadays, you know, most of the people are, uh, you know, very much concerned about the, you know, our… They are focused on the A guardrails, right? Anything related to that? Are you, uh…

03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:15.000
Mm-hmm. Uh, yes, even recently, right? If someone would like to, like, learn a guardrails.

03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:25.000
So, I have already discussed, there was a batch in RAG. Recently, I released the video. Someone has even asked me, like, uh, in my group.

03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:40.000
This hybrid, and here… If you would like to go ahead with that, you can just try to go ahead with that. So, these are the guardrails, right? So, basically, a rear anchor BM5 scoring, benchmarking, basically, we are trying to do, or re-ranking the model.

03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:47.000
So I've already discussed, if you would like to go ahead with this now, you can just go ahead with that. Otherwise, wait for your live class.

03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:51.000
Sure, sure. What about MLflow? Are we going to use that?

03:03:51.000 --> 03:03:59.000
In this one, I'm not covering MLflow. It's, uh, I used to cover MLflow in my ML lectures. So, we already have a course even for MLOps. Uh, you can try to, like.

03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:07.000
Uh, check that part, so MLOps, we have our multiple version, and it's already covered in detail, but not in this one.

03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:12.000
Because, like I said, people will keep on asking, like, 10 things that discuss, are you discussing that, this, no.

03:04:12.000 --> 03:04:26.000
That's the reason, so we have a particular syllabus. Whatever is mentioned in the syllabus, I'll just go ahead with that. If you're looking for something else, uh, we have that, maybe. You can go and explore. And mostly, you will be able to find out everything on Elon platform.

03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:29.000
But everything I'm not going to discuss in every batches. Yeah.

03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:37.000
Understood, understood. So, basically… how long we have to, I mean, daily, how much time do you think we have to… We'll see. Bye.

03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:44.000
Sorry, let's see, everyone's capacity is different, right? We all are human beings, and obviously we have a different kind of energy, we have a different kind of a talent, plus experience, right?

03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:56.000
Uh, on an average, I would say, uh, initially, try to spend 1 or 2 hours. Eventually, when I'll give you a task, let's suppose that task is going to take a 20-hour effort, or 30-hour effort in terms of building the end-to-end project.

03:04:56.000 --> 03:04:59.000
You have to put up that much of a word. But initially, just for the learning as you're starting, maybe one, one and a half hour regular basis is more than enough.

03:04:59.000 --> 03:05:04.000
Okay.

03:05:04.000 --> 03:05:13.000
Tasks, it takes time. So it takes time. And you have to build it. If you're not going to build it, again, that will be your choice. I can't force anyone, by the way.

03:05:13.000 --> 03:05:19.000
Right, uh, because we are not in a college, uh, or schools, uh, we are in a professional journey.

03:05:19.000 --> 03:05:27.000
Uh, but yes, I strongly recommend you to complete those challenges and tasks which I'm going to give you, which is a time-taking thing.

03:05:27.000 --> 03:05:31.000
Because that… that will… that is the only thing which will give you a real-time expertise.

03:05:31.000 --> 03:05:41.000
Yeah, so, see, with experienced people, right, generally people, uh, nowadays, you know, expect a multi-cloud kind of.

03:05:41.000 --> 03:05:48.000
Skills, okay, and I'm mainly into… I show that I will extend… I show that engineering components.

03:05:48.000 --> 03:06:00.000
So, uh, do you think, uh, for the time being, at least, uh, go with the Azure, uh, B stack and the JNA tools in Azure?

03:06:00.000 --> 03:06:01.000
Go with only one cloud. Aws is also fine, Azure is also fine, GCP is also fine.

03:06:01.000 --> 03:06:04.000
And then…

03:06:04.000 --> 03:06:09.000
Mostly in my classes, I will be using, like, this one, uh, AWS.

03:06:09.000 --> 03:06:10.000
Kind of…

03:06:10.000 --> 03:06:16.000
Uh, for Azure, I have a course, Big Data with Azure. That course I have already launched. Even we have a Genitive AI with Cloud. Over there also, I'm covering.

03:06:16.000 --> 03:06:20.000
All the cloud component. Small, small component, from all three cloud, I'm covering.

03:06:20.000 --> 03:06:28.000
But in this one, for hosting and deployment, we need a cloud platform, and Majorly, I will be using AWS, at least for this batch. But yeah, if you're looking for something different.

03:06:28.000 --> 03:06:38.000
Like I said, on the non-platform, you'll find everything. In a batch, I'll stick to syllabus, because you must have heard the… other conversation, right?

03:06:38.000 --> 03:06:41.000
People will come and say, are you discussing this? Are you discussing that?

03:06:41.000 --> 03:06:44.000
I say, only syllabus.

03:06:44.000 --> 03:06:47.000
Yeah, that's true. Okay. Thank you.

03:06:47.000 --> 03:06:55.000
Yeah. Okay, fine, no, thank you. Uh, next, uh, who would like to go? Uh, so, yeah, anyone.

03:06:55.000 --> 03:06:56.000
Yeah, Ujjal, go ahead.

03:06:56.000 --> 03:07:04.000
Start, uh… Uh, hello, sir. Uh, like, I have been associated with iNeuron, so I'm… I'm your student since 2022.

03:07:04.000 --> 03:07:05.000
But I was not able to, uh, do a transition into data science that time.

03:07:05.000 --> 03:07:11.000
Okay, thank you.

03:07:11.000 --> 03:07:12.000
Okay, okay.

03:07:12.000 --> 03:07:18.000
So I went in the observability domain. And in that, I'm working in a customer-facing role with the enterprise customers of India, like fintech, gaming.

03:07:18.000 --> 03:07:19.000
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

03:07:19.000 --> 03:07:30.000
Media, all those customers. So, sir, I am in customer-facing role, where I do POC, RFP, and then onboarding of our product, which is in the observability domain.

03:07:30.000 --> 03:07:31.000
Mm-hmm.

03:07:31.000 --> 03:07:38.000
So, what will be the impact of the AI, sir, on customer-facing role-like solution consultant or technical account manager? So.

03:07:38.000 --> 03:07:44.000
And how does Gen AI will help. Uh, like, I'm speaking to my customers who are already.

03:07:44.000 --> 03:07:48.000
Interested in their building models, and they are trying to monitor.

03:07:48.000 --> 03:07:56.000
Uh, their models and LLM models. So, as a customer-facing role, like, how this will help me, sir? Like, learning this Gen AI part.

03:07:56.000 --> 03:08:00.000
What problem we are solving for the customer, first of all? So, what kind of problem are you solving? Or maybe your company.

03:08:00.000 --> 03:08:17.000
So… so… Yeah, so usually, like, I speak to the stakeholders, SREs, developers, solution architects, who are basically monitoring their technical stack, like, their application, APM performance, like, metrics, events, logs, traces.

03:08:17.000 --> 03:08:18.000
And, uh, then monitoring of the tokens. So we… we have all those integrations in our product.

03:08:18.000 --> 03:08:23.000
Mm-hmm, mm.

03:08:23.000 --> 03:08:24.000
Mm-hmm.

03:08:24.000 --> 03:08:30.000
So we do monitoring of Databricks, AWS, Azure, mobile monitoring, browser monitoring, like, how page load is there, and all those Google Core Web Vitals.

03:08:30.000 --> 03:08:32.000
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:41.000
So, I understand the tech stack, like, infra. Infra and cloud and Kubernetes, all those monitoring we are doing, and now we have started monitoring of LLMs also.

03:08:41.000 --> 03:08:54.000
So, that is what my question is, like, if I am in this, uh… Customer-facing role, like, shall I stay in customer-facing role, or shall I… become some kind of architect, so that I can also build something by myself, rather than.

03:08:54.000 --> 03:08:55.000
Staying as a consultant.

03:08:55.000 --> 03:09:05.000
I think going forward, going forward, your path will move towards an architect, but yeah, so that depends upon the role that company is going to give you, or you are going to take it, any, like, both the ways.

03:09:05.000 --> 03:09:07.000
Hmm.

03:09:07.000 --> 03:09:12.000
All right. Uh, but, uh, yeah, so, uh, basically there is a scope. People are doing it, so you will be able to do it.

03:09:12.000 --> 03:09:20.000
Okay, in my company also, like, there are some roles, like product manager, AIOps, and all those kinds.

03:09:20.000 --> 03:09:21.000
Mm-hmm. Don't go for product management, but yeah, go for the tech one.

03:09:21.000 --> 03:09:37.000
So I'm thinking that maybe if I learn this gene, either I can go, uh… Okay, okay, okay. Because my, uh… Uh, my experience is, like, uh, 4 years in observability, and total is, like, 13 years, so… That's what I… I have been in the customer-facing roles only.

03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:43.000
Mm-hmm.

03:09:43.000 --> 03:09:44.000
Because some of this thing is also good. I think it's a stable job, and it's not moving anywhere very soon.

03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:48.000
So, will AI impact, like, uh, like, POCs, RFPs?

03:09:48.000 --> 03:09:49.000
Okay.

03:09:49.000 --> 03:09:55.000
Right, uh, because every company has to, like, handle it and has to run the business, right? And that, too, with respect to a customer. Doesn't matter how many machines we are going to deploy, or what kind of AI, at the end of the day, we have to sell AI even to a customer.

03:09:55.000 --> 03:10:01.000
Hmm.

03:10:01.000 --> 03:10:02.000
Right.

03:10:02.000 --> 03:10:11.000
Sure, sure, and okay. So, like, companies like Redis, GitHub, so, like, they, like, they have also approached me on LinkedIn, but I was afraid that I don't know.

03:10:11.000 --> 03:10:12.000
All these things, so I have not given any interview, but.

03:10:12.000 --> 03:10:15.000
Hmm.

03:10:15.000 --> 03:10:17.000
I have seen, like, they found my profile suitable for, like, technical account manager, because they want to sell RADIUS Databricks, and all those…

03:10:17.000 --> 03:10:25.000
Hmm, hmm. Exactly, you see, this is not going… see, it doesn't matter what tech you're going to build, right? Uh, how advanced the AI will be. At the end of the day, every company has to generate a revenue.

03:10:25.000 --> 03:10:31.000
Mm-hmm.

03:10:31.000 --> 03:10:35.000
And that is going to come from the real human being.

03:10:35.000 --> 03:10:37.000
Yeah, so I'm inside a techno-functional role, so would you suggest, like, learning?

03:10:37.000 --> 03:10:39.000
That is actually better, I would say. That is actually better, because it's tough to replace.

03:10:39.000 --> 03:10:44.000
Okay. Okay, yes, sir, okay, okay.

03:10:44.000 --> 03:10:45.000
Fine. So, I'll just learn this genei so that I can speak to my customers confidently.

03:10:45.000 --> 03:10:56.000
Yeah. Exactly, exactly. And you can propose, like, a 10 other solution which doesn't even exist.

03:10:56.000 --> 03:11:00.000
Yeah, okay, thanks, yeah. Okay, go ahead, Vikas, Vidant, anyone? One, one person, anyone, yeah.

03:11:00.000 --> 03:11:01.000
Uh, hello, Sudancho.

03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:05.000
Yeah, he actually answered. Yeah, hi, uh, Sudan Shu. This is Vikas. So, thank you so much for giving this opportunity. Since 2021, I have been associated with you.

03:11:05.000 --> 03:11:11.000
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, because…

03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:12.000
Thank you. I think we did a good job in previous company, I believe.

03:11:12.000 --> 03:11:22.000
The iron side. Alright, so, uh, you know, like, uh, I have… Yes, yes, yes, yes.

03:11:22.000 --> 03:11:28.000
So, uh, so for this, I mean, you know, like, uh, currently I'm working in a startup, it's my own startup.

03:11:28.000 --> 03:11:34.000
Uh, previously I was, you know, into the data science, then I moved into the core product management.

03:11:34.000 --> 03:11:35.000
With the essence of data science. Now I am feeling challenged because now it is the market is in dip, okay.

03:11:35.000 --> 03:11:40.000
Uh… huh.

03:11:40.000 --> 03:11:48.000
And the complete business side. You know, and balancing the technical aspects. So now, again, I'm moving into the technical product management.

03:11:48.000 --> 03:11:49.000
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

03:11:49.000 --> 03:11:53.000
So does this definitely help me, or should I go into the core? I'm in engineering again, uh… Yes, yes, yes.

03:11:53.000 --> 03:12:01.000
Technical product management, right? I'll say it's a dicey one. Go into a core herbals, not immediately, it's not an immediate threat, but what I see.

03:12:01.000 --> 03:12:02.000
Yeah.

03:12:02.000 --> 03:12:10.000
Oh, that's not… Hello, wait longer, listen.

03:12:10.000 --> 03:12:11.000
Sneha. Sneha, could you please mute?

03:12:11.000 --> 03:12:24.000
Going… just weight by weight. So, uh, basic… what I… Okay, let me, uh, let me… Hi, I have muted, not an issue. Yeah, so what I will, uh, suggest to you that, that, uh, try to get into a complete, like, a technical one. That will be, like, much better going forward.

03:12:24.000 --> 03:12:40.000
Product management, uh… because, see, uh, the thing is that generally, as a product manager, right, when I see someone, when I talk to someone, so I just get a feeling that, okay, fine, so you are the one who think about the new feature, or maybe the aesthetic look, or customer experience, and everything, right? And this is how the entire industry thinks.

03:12:40.000 --> 03:12:47.000
Uh, and generally, product managers are considered to be as a non-tech kind of a person.

03:12:47.000 --> 03:12:59.000
But nowadays, there is a trend inside the industry that I'm looking for a product manager who understands my customer, who understands my business, who can build up features by understanding customers and a market and a competitor, right?

03:12:59.000 --> 03:13:00.000
Correct. Yes.

03:13:00.000 --> 03:13:16.000
And who can really develop things? Because, see, everyone is using AI to even to generate a code. Maybe good or bad, that's a different, like, discussion, by the way, right? But still, we are using AI to create the MVPs or POCs kind of a things, or even to develop a new feature, or even to write a production-grade code.

03:13:16.000 --> 03:13:19.000
Not 100%, I would say, but still 30-40%, we are using it. Even in Iran, we are using it. That's the platform that you are able to see, right?

03:13:19.000 --> 03:13:23.000
Yes, yes, so… Yeah.

03:13:23.000 --> 03:13:28.000
So we are able to build this platform in just 10 months of time, record 10 months of time, and very limited team member.

03:13:28.000 --> 03:13:29.000
Correct, correct.

03:13:29.000 --> 03:13:36.000
Right? A very limited… and even before you have seen the Iron Knight. So, we have taken almost, like, a 3 year of time to build that ecosystem.

03:13:36.000 --> 03:13:41.000
So, before the iNeuron, you know, like, I was also taking the big data course from you.

03:13:41.000 --> 03:13:44.000
And there was no dashboard even, right? At that point of a time, I mean?

03:13:44.000 --> 03:13:45.000
Yes, yes, true, true.

03:13:45.000 --> 03:14:00.000
Exactly. So, that… there was a tough… there was a time, so when we have seen, and again, we all have seen, not just IE, so we have seen that things was taking time to build it, and now this Euron ecosystem is even way complex than the previous one, but still in a almost 1 by 4th.

03:14:00.000 --> 03:14:02.000
Time, we are able to build it, right? All thanks to AI, right? All thanks to AI.

03:14:02.000 --> 03:14:05.000
Got it.

03:14:05.000 --> 03:14:10.000
Ai is a reality no one is expecting you to just be a product manager.

03:14:10.000 --> 03:14:24.000
Right? So, people are expecting you that you should have a hands-on, you understand a complete infra path, you understand the system, you understand a customer, and that kind of a person, right? That kind of a person will be able to go very, very long into industry.

03:14:24.000 --> 03:14:31.000
If you are not that kind of a person, then obviously there is a threat, and I believe we have observed that, right? A layoff that is going around us.

03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:32.000
Right, so we all are aware about the news, so there is nothing hidden, by the way.

03:14:32.000 --> 03:14:35.000
Yes, correct.

03:14:35.000 --> 03:14:36.000
Right. So I'll recommend that, uh, try to be that person who can, like, single-handedly.

03:14:36.000 --> 03:14:40.000
Yeah, yeah.

03:14:40.000 --> 03:14:42.000
Build something on their own, and that person will never be relevant, doesn't matter how advanced AI will be… will become.

03:14:42.000 --> 03:14:48.000
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

03:14:48.000 --> 03:14:49.000
Yeah.

03:14:49.000 --> 03:14:54.000
Sure, sure. Thank you. So, I mean, are you suggesting that going into more technical? Because, uh, whatever you've mentioned, like the infra part, customer segment, yeah.

03:14:54.000 --> 03:14:56.000
As… yeah. As… Yes, as your experience is increasing, right?

03:14:56.000 --> 03:15:01.000
Feature development, hands-on and on. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, yeah.

03:15:01.000 --> 03:15:08.000
I will always recommend, and nowadays I'm recommending to everyone, that try to become a person who can handle.

03:15:08.000 --> 03:15:09.000
Everything on their own. Simple. Whether it's a tech, whether it's a non-tech, I'm talking about both.

03:15:09.000 --> 03:15:14.000
Yes. True.

03:15:14.000 --> 03:15:29.000
Now, and it's not that tough, see, you have experience already, so you have already seen a lot. It's not like you are new to a market, or you don't have experience, you have never seen the product, you have already seen a lot, right? So you just have to add a little, little things on top of each and every one.

03:15:29.000 --> 03:15:36.000
Simple, yeah? Yep, thanks, thanks to Kirk. Yeah, Pallavi, please go ahead.

03:15:36.000 --> 03:15:37.000
Hello, ma'am. Yeah, please go ahead, ma'am.

03:15:37.000 --> 03:15:47.000
Uh, yeah, hi, Stanzu, uh… So, actually, I have, uh, 10 years of experience, and until a couple of months back, I was thinking that it's too late for me to enter the field of AI.

03:15:47.000 --> 03:15:48.000
Mm-hmm.

03:15:48.000 --> 03:15:53.000
Uh, but, uh, coincidentally, I got an opportunity to work on a time series use case.

03:15:53.000 --> 03:15:54.000
Uh, so basically, what we are doing, like, we are, uh, fetching the Grafana, uh.

03:15:54.000 --> 03:15:59.000
Mm-hmm.

03:15:59.000 --> 03:16:00.000
Mm-hmm.

03:16:00.000 --> 03:16:09.000
Data, and we are trying to do the forecasting. So, I got some internal trainings, and also I did some course from Udemy and YouTube as well.

03:16:09.000 --> 03:16:10.000
Mm-hmm.

03:16:10.000 --> 03:16:23.000
So, uh, I'm learning and implementing as well. So now, I was thinking that, uh, is it the right time to go, or am I too late to go into this, or… How should I proceed? I'm…

03:16:23.000 --> 03:16:31.000
10-year is not a late, ma'am, so we have our batch mates who is having, like, a 70 year, and he's willing to put up time and effort.

03:16:31.000 --> 03:16:32.000
Right? It's not… 10 years is very early, like, it's just one decade, right?

03:16:32.000 --> 03:16:37.000
Okay.

03:16:37.000 --> 03:16:43.000
There's nothing. So you have a time when, like, a complete runway to explore anything, and I think you should do it.

03:16:43.000 --> 03:16:55.000
So, my use case is, like, to forecast the CPU usage amount, and if it exceeds by 90%, then we have to.

03:16:55.000 --> 03:16:56.000
Hmm.

03:16:56.000 --> 03:17:04.000
Generate some alert, and inform the users. So, uh, so right now, I'm just using simple autoregression and, uh, ARIMA model, as well as some profit model as well.

03:17:04.000 --> 03:17:09.000
Uh, so, can it be also implemented later on using Gen AI, or should I stick to machine learning only?

03:17:09.000 --> 03:17:20.000
Um, uh, I think… I don't think that it's a correct approach even now. Maybe, like, you are spinning a new machine, or maybe you are generating an alert based on the conjunction.

03:17:20.000 --> 03:17:31.000
Um, it's not even a machine learning problem. I mean, like, it's unnecessary to use or, like, uh… do this kind of engineering, it can be done even with the help of, uh, like, uh, rule-based.

03:17:31.000 --> 03:17:40.000
Uh, and, uh, again, if I'll talk about the LLNs. So, yes, just feed your entire log to LLMs, and then, uh, like, generate triggers.

03:17:40.000 --> 03:17:43.000
With the help of LLMs, it can be done. You don't have to train any models.

03:17:43.000 --> 03:17:44.000
Okay, thanks.

03:17:44.000 --> 03:17:51.000
Right? But even… I have seen this kind of a system. Even we are using it, and I keep on getting alerts a lot of times when my, uh, like, system.

03:17:51.000 --> 03:18:00.000
Goes for the full load traffic, or when my system goes for a full load of API request, right? And even we are doing it, and every company does that.

03:18:00.000 --> 03:18:02.000
We are using a very simple approach.

03:18:02.000 --> 03:18:06.000
So, the model approach is not relevant over here. What you're suggesting, and…

03:18:06.000 --> 03:18:16.000
Yeah, this is what I say. Even, like, 5 years back, it was not relevant. Much relevant. Unless and until you are trying to find out some regular anomalies based on the past event. Let's suppose.

03:18:16.000 --> 03:18:24.000
See, there are, like, a different problem statement, right? One problem statement is that, that I have to just generate an alert. So when a machine reaches with this capacity, right?

03:18:24.000 --> 03:18:31.000
Now, in that case, I don't think that model approach is required. Second one… second problem statement could be that, okay, I have to detect the anomaly.

03:18:31.000 --> 03:18:40.000
Right? I have to detect some sort of an anomaly based on a previous event which has already happened, and it's a, uh, like, a highly sensitive system, which I'm dealing with.

03:18:40.000 --> 03:18:49.000
Then I can understand that there should be a model-driven approach, right, which can eventually be now converted into a LLM.

03:18:49.000 --> 03:18:55.000
Okay, and also the second use case was, like, uh, in future, if, uh, like, in near future, if, uh.

03:18:55.000 --> 03:19:04.000
Uh, the, uh, usage increased more than 90%, then, uh, it should recommend the user for, uh, increasing their, uh.

03:19:04.000 --> 03:19:06.000
Cpu size, so…

03:19:06.000 --> 03:19:21.000
B never recommended. We auto-spin the CPUs. Who recommend? You are going to send a message to the user, user, uh, let's suppose there is a 12 o'clock night, user is sleeping, or whoever is someone, some human wing will be taking care of, like, that system, right? You're sending the alert.

03:19:21.000 --> 03:19:26.000
Uh, so they will wake up, and then they will, like, click, and then they will spin the machine. We don't do that.

03:19:26.000 --> 03:19:32.000
That's the reason, so, in every cloud platform, whenever you will deploy, there is the auto-skilling feature, just switch it on.

03:19:32.000 --> 03:19:33.000
Uh, I…

03:19:33.000 --> 03:19:40.000
Simple. And then you can set up the machine that, okay, fine, so on this capacity, so basically this machine should autospin and go to this capacity. And every cloud platform is providing you that.

03:19:40.000 --> 03:19:52.000
Actually, there is a dedicated solution design team who just, uh, approves these kind of requests, uh, whoever, uh, I mean, requests come to increase the CPU size.

03:19:52.000 --> 03:19:57.000
So, and it is a very long process, like, it almost takes a month.

03:19:57.000 --> 03:19:58.000
Are we still doing it, such kind of things?

03:19:58.000 --> 03:20:01.000
Of time, too. Uh, yeah, it is being done in, uh… Uh, I'm… So that's why, uh, um…

03:20:01.000 --> 03:20:18.000
Uh, I assume it should be replaced. Most of the players, I believe. If I'm the, like, one who's handling things, I would have replaced it, like, a couple of years back. If still we are doing that, if we are dealing with such system.

03:20:18.000 --> 03:20:23.000
So there is a dedicated architecture team who, uh, I mean, reads all the Grafana readings, and then.

03:20:23.000 --> 03:20:30.000
I… I don't think that, uh… It should happen in their… they're burning money.

03:20:30.000 --> 03:20:43.000
Technically, this is what my take is. If the situation that you are trying to explain, and the situation which I'm able to understand, again, see, there could be a different scenario, XYZ, so, uh, like, uh, then maybe that is possible, and that is even valid.

03:20:43.000 --> 03:20:49.000
But the situation that you are trying to explain it to me, and the way I'm able to pursue it.

03:20:49.000 --> 03:20:52.000
I think that teams should not, like, exist.

03:20:52.000 --> 03:20:56.000
Okay, but that can be automated using the approach that I am doing.

03:20:56.000 --> 03:20:58.000
My entire world has automated already. The entire world has already done that, right? Not just one or two people, entire world has done that.

03:20:58.000 --> 03:21:03.000
Okay. Okay.

03:21:03.000 --> 03:21:10.000
If the situation is same, right, because depends, right? So, whatever you are trying to explain, maybe I'm not able to understand that part.

03:21:10.000 --> 03:21:14.000
Right? So I can't comment, but yeah, if this is the exact situation.

03:21:14.000 --> 03:21:15.000
Then it's not.

03:21:15.000 --> 03:21:23.000
Um, from, like, investment bank, and they are, like, way behind using the AI, uh, still.

03:21:23.000 --> 03:21:24.000
What I think.

03:21:24.000 --> 03:21:29.000
Yes. They are, like, way behind. I think you should switch the organization then.

03:21:29.000 --> 03:21:36.000
Okay. Uh, and also, I mean, my second question is, uh.

03:21:36.000 --> 03:21:41.000
Like, uh, with 10 years of experience, apart from this course, what else should I focus on?

03:21:41.000 --> 03:21:51.000
Nothing then, just first focus on this one, right? If, like, I'm giving you a coursework and I'm giving you challenges, just do it.

03:21:51.000 --> 03:21:52.000
Oh, okay, thank you, thank you so much for your time.

03:21:52.000 --> 03:21:55.000
That's fine. Yeah? Yeah, yeah, yeah, thanks.

03:21:55.000 --> 03:21:58.000
Okay, next one, Briggang Gupta. Yeah, I believe it.

03:21:58.000 --> 03:22:05.000
Hello, hello, sir? Sir, I would like to know, like, how this course will help me, uh, from a testing background.

03:22:05.000 --> 03:22:06.000
It will… it will… it will, it will help you out to become a genetic engineer.

03:22:06.000 --> 03:22:09.000
Coming from a… Okay, sir.

03:22:09.000 --> 03:22:17.000
Yeah. Okay, Anil, please go ahead.

03:22:17.000 --> 03:22:18.000
Yeah, hi. Lizzo?

03:22:18.000 --> 03:22:23.000
Hi, Sidansha, good afternoon. Uh, it's nice talking to you. See, there are a few questions which are already answered, and uh… One is, like, this is a Saturday-Sunday class, right?

03:22:23.000 --> 03:22:32.000
Okay, mm-hmm. This is our resident class, yeah, yeah. Already, I have mentioned, so everything is mentioned here.

03:22:32.000 --> 03:22:33.000
Uh, that it's a Saturday, Sunday, and timing is also given.

03:22:33.000 --> 03:22:43.000
Okay. So, like, I mean, uh… to get more interest and to practice more on this, like, you will give the assignments, right? Like, uh… I mean, I don't know.

03:22:43.000 --> 03:22:50.000
Not just assignment, I don't believe in, like, much of assignment. I'll give a challenge, basically.

03:22:50.000 --> 03:22:51.000
Yeah.

03:22:51.000 --> 03:22:59.000
Okay, yeah, fine, whatever. And another question is, like, having, like, a 15-plus experience in the, um, like.

03:22:59.000 --> 03:23:05.000
Like, everybody have, like, a few or worked on the development, fewer worked on the automation, fewer worked on this, uh, manager, I liked it.

03:23:05.000 --> 03:23:06.000
Mm-hmm.

03:23:06.000 --> 03:23:15.000
So, like, which is the right to approach, like, because as AI comes to, like, last one, two years, it becomes very popular.

03:23:15.000 --> 03:23:16.000
Mm-hmm.

03:23:16.000 --> 03:23:21.000
So, like, every… most of the companies, uh, request human. Team to, like, switch to a… like, like, how to.

03:23:21.000 --> 03:23:23.000
Mm-hmm.

03:23:23.000 --> 03:23:28.000
Move further, like, which, like, based on the past experience, which is the right position.

03:23:28.000 --> 03:23:29.000
Like, if you can guide, like… Okay, sure.

03:23:29.000 --> 03:23:35.000
So, like, just, just, yeah, just, just be with me for next 2-3 months, right? Believe me, you will be able to figure it out.

03:23:35.000 --> 03:23:36.000
Because, see, initially when we start, right, so obviously, it's a human nature that we will be in a dilemma.

03:23:36.000 --> 03:23:40.000
Okay.

03:23:40.000 --> 03:23:48.000
That how this is going to happen, that is going to happen. That's pretty much obvious, I feel. And every time I see the same thing, right, since last year.

03:23:48.000 --> 03:23:55.000
So, just be with me for a couple of months. I believe, uh, uh, we will try to figure it out, uh.

03:23:55.000 --> 03:24:04.000
Out of our discussion, very soon. Yeah.

03:24:04.000 --> 03:24:05.000
It's required, sir. I think it's required. It's pretty much required for every one of us.

03:24:05.000 --> 03:24:07.000
Okay, yeah, as requested, just, uh, I'm trying to upgrade, uh, to the…

03:24:07.000 --> 03:24:08.000
Yeah, so, like, we can access multiple things.

03:24:08.000 --> 03:24:17.000
Right? Exactly, exactly. If you are not upgrading it, then, uh, again, we have… we are, like, looking at the situation in industry, right? So, how things are moving, basically.

03:24:17.000 --> 03:24:18.000
So, I think it's a need of an hour, and we can't escape that part.

03:24:18.000 --> 03:24:23.000
Yeah, true, true, yeah.

03:24:23.000 --> 03:24:30.000
Yep, yep, yep. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, Vedant, please go ahead.

03:24:30.000 --> 03:24:31.000
Yes, Yavedant, please go ahead, yeah, with your question.

03:24:31.000 --> 03:24:39.000
So I do, but never… Uh, let's see… Hello, sir, I am a fourth-year student in computer science at security.

03:24:39.000 --> 03:24:40.000
Uh, I was basically working on a project which was an AI code review assistant.

03:24:40.000 --> 03:24:47.000
Mm-hmm.

03:24:47.000 --> 03:24:48.000
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

03:24:48.000 --> 03:24:54.000
Which included GitHub MCP. Uh, the GitHub MCP has a tool which lets you access your private repository.

03:24:54.000 --> 03:24:55.000
Hmm.

03:24:55.000 --> 03:25:01.000
So, can you please talk a little about AI security? Because technologies like MCP are vulnerable to cyber attacks.

03:25:01.000 --> 03:25:24.000
See, uh, MCP is still in a very, very, I would say, initial stage, right? And obviously, if you are trying to give an… because, see, MCPs, at the end of the day, you're trying to create the small interface, and by which you are giving an access to XYZ system, right? So maybe you're, like, a closed secured system, but yes, MCP will be able to access it automatically based on the chat and based on the prompt, if user is going to hit.

03:25:24.000 --> 03:25:37.000
So, still, I will say that, uh. We should wait, we should wait for a better framework, uh, which will… which people are developing. So, obviously, in the next 6 or 8 months, we'll be having a better and better look, uh, robust security layer on top of it.

03:25:37.000 --> 03:25:43.000
And, uh, I believe if you follow the news, we all are getting that news, right? We are adding a heavy layer of our security around it.

03:25:43.000 --> 03:25:52.000
So, I believe in a year of time, it will be more secured. As of now, uh, we should not, like, just give an access to, uh, whatever code that we are writing.

03:25:52.000 --> 03:25:55.000
Eventually, MZP. At least, like, don't, don't, like, use it in a production.

03:25:55.000 --> 03:25:58.000
So, I also have this…

03:25:58.000 --> 03:26:05.000
Uh, at least I'll recommend it that, as of now, don't use it in a production too frequently, unless and until it's not well tested.

03:26:05.000 --> 03:26:06.000
By a security expert. Mm-hmm.

03:26:06.000 --> 03:26:16.000
Uh, okay, okay. Sir, uh, I have one more question. Uh, so as I am a fourth-year student, companies have started visiting my college for on-campus placements.

03:26:16.000 --> 03:26:17.000
Mm-hmm.

03:26:17.000 --> 03:26:24.000
Uh, one company visited. Uh, it was airing for AI engineer and was giving a very good package.

03:26:24.000 --> 03:26:25.000
But they were asking hard DSA questions in their online assessment.

03:26:25.000 --> 03:26:28.000
Mm-hmm.

03:26:28.000 --> 03:26:35.000
Uh, but I haven't done a lot of this, so I want to ask you that, how should I get a fresher job as an AI engineer?

03:26:35.000 --> 03:26:46.000
Uh, see, try to apply from outside. See, I have seen that many companies, right? Many companies, doesn't matter, uh, for what profile they are hiring, but yes, they try to create a benchmark by asking a DSA question in a.

03:26:46.000 --> 03:27:01.000
First couple of rounds, and that's pretty much true. For a product-based company, where they are trying to, like, uh, test your logical thinking or approach to a problem solving, all those things, which is, again, a valid approach, but if you are moving in a world of a startup, and.

03:27:01.000 --> 03:27:15.000
Mncs, I don't think that they will ask any kind of a DSA question. They will stick to your core profile, which is a data science, or maybe generative AI, right? So start applying in those companies, and if your college is calling those kind of companies, then it's well and good.

03:27:15.000 --> 03:27:18.000
Yeah? Otherwise, from outside, you just apply it. All the options are available.

03:27:18.000 --> 03:27:21.000
Okay, so… Thank you.

03:27:21.000 --> 03:27:28.000
Yeah, yeah, we don't. Okay, Rajias, please go ahead.

03:27:28.000 --> 03:27:32.000
Yeah, Rajesh? Uh, Arman, please go ahead.

03:27:32.000 --> 03:27:33.000
Yeah, Raji, please go ahead. Right.

03:27:33.000 --> 03:27:40.000
Hello? So, first of all, thank you so much for today's class. So, this is the first time I have attended your lecture.

03:27:40.000 --> 03:27:41.000
Okay, thank you.

03:27:41.000 --> 03:27:51.000
And I really like the Euron ecosystem that you showcased in the first half of the session, which includes the UV API, ReconI builder, and Promodoro Focus app, and others.

03:27:51.000 --> 03:27:52.000
Thank you.

03:27:52.000 --> 03:28:02.000
Um, so, uh, with respect to the force, I just have a few questions based upon my experience. So, my current role, uh, like, involves me to… and to actually architect the entire ecosystem.

03:28:02.000 --> 03:28:03.000
Mm-hmm.

03:28:03.000 --> 03:28:09.000
Uh, related to the GenA applications, and which also involves a productionizing the POCs also that the team is currently doing.

03:28:09.000 --> 03:28:10.000
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

03:28:10.000 --> 03:28:18.000
So, my focus is how much you will be covering on scaling the application versus scaling the entire data processing pipelines.

03:28:18.000 --> 03:28:26.000
And how much you will be deep diving into the low-level design and high-level design, and, like, how to basically containerizing the applications and.

03:28:26.000 --> 03:28:36.000
How to, uh, structure the entire API framework. So, when I'm saying API framework, like, there are multiple ways by which we can, uh, actually schedule it, either by using the synchronous.

03:28:36.000 --> 03:28:42.000
How much, uh, focus you will be, uh, like, putting around these points.

03:28:42.000 --> 03:28:58.000
See, there are a lot of, like, things that you have asked all together in terms of scaling, hosting, and inferencing, and then, like, uh, latency, and many things, right? I'll simply say one thing over here, that, uh, when, by the time we will come over here.

03:28:58.000 --> 03:29:05.000
Right. By the time we will come over here, at least in a budget session, and especially this project, we will end up building something which you are using even now.

03:29:05.000 --> 03:29:08.000
And that, too, on a scale. And that will answer all your.

03:29:08.000 --> 03:29:11.000
Mm-hmm, okay.

03:29:11.000 --> 03:29:26.000
I believe. This is a real project product. In a real time, people are using it, right? That to be the multiple heavy and smaller big model inferencing, with a lot of, like, latex operation, which goes on when you are trying to, like, chat with this kind of a system.

03:29:26.000 --> 03:29:32.000
And this kind of a system, we will be doing in our live class.

03:29:32.000 --> 03:29:33.000
Okay, okay, good.

03:29:33.000 --> 03:29:43.000
And that will answer all your questions, right? Whatever you have asked, basically, because everything was around the end product development.

03:29:43.000 --> 03:29:44.000
Yeah, yeah. Okay, fine.

03:29:44.000 --> 03:29:47.000
And this is what we are going to do. Okay? Yeah, so that might answer to your question. Yeah, thank you.

03:29:47.000 --> 03:29:54.000
So, Buskar, please go ahead, uh, with your question. Yeah, Poscaro?

03:29:54.000 --> 03:29:58.000
Aramadan? Arman was asking also a question, right? Yeah, Mukesh… Yeah, yeah, Puska, please go ahead.

03:29:58.000 --> 03:30:09.000
Uh, hello, sir. Pushka here. So, my question is simple, that's, is it possible to have tailored on all AI systems and use cases come?

03:30:09.000 --> 03:30:10.000
Sorry, Puskar, your voice was breaking, what was your question? Can we just repeat once again?

03:30:10.000 --> 03:30:17.000
But we didn't report off very nice.

03:30:17.000 --> 03:30:18.000
Yeah, it's audible, yes, yes.

03:30:18.000 --> 03:30:28.000
So, is it audible now? Okay, sir, my question is that, uh, is it possible to have clarity on the whole AI system design, uh, that particularly system design in any use cases come regarding any project?

03:30:28.000 --> 03:30:41.000
It is… it is… it is possible, it is possible. I'm planning to bring some sort of a, like, uh, courses even around that. So, I'm just struggling with my bandwidth, uh, so I have a limited time, but yeah, so I'm planning to bring some sort of, uh, courses.

03:30:41.000 --> 03:30:54.000
Just across our AI system design, that how do we, like, create or orchestrate the entire system for our AI? How does that work? And that, too, case-wise case basis, because every system, like, uh.

03:30:54.000 --> 03:31:00.000
Can't follow the one single rule to design it. I'm planning it, uh, let's see, so how soon I can bring it.

03:31:00.000 --> 03:31:01.000
Okay, let's… thank you. Yes, yes. Great.

03:31:01.000 --> 03:31:11.000
Yeah. Still… but yeah, it's a part of my plan. So… Yeah. Oh, yeah, so Arman Mukesh, anyone, please go ahead.

03:31:11.000 --> 03:31:12.000
Yeah, please go ahead.

03:31:12.000 --> 03:31:22.000
Yeah, hi, Mukesh, this side. Yeah, so just now I have enrolled, uh, for this course, uh, basically for, uh, one year, and, uh, I saw your status, and then I just… But I missed, like, what are the, uh, 2 hours you have taken, uh, sessions today.

03:31:22.000 --> 03:31:28.000
Okay. Okay, okay.

03:31:28.000 --> 03:31:35.000
Yeah, and uh… to be frank, like, I'm, uh, I'm, like, working in a banking, uh, uh.

03:31:35.000 --> 03:31:36.000
Sector, uh, private bank, and, uh, for, like, reliege management I am working for.

03:31:36.000 --> 03:31:40.000
Mm-hmm.

03:31:40.000 --> 03:31:49.000
And uh… and they are… they have a different segment, say, uh, AI, uh, like, you know, they're whole gentiles, but, uh.

03:31:49.000 --> 03:31:53.000
To be on that, uh, team, uh, I need to learn that AI and, uh, gen AI, basically.

03:31:53.000 --> 03:31:55.000
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

03:31:55.000 --> 03:32:01.000
So, uh, this is the good, uh, uh, like, course for me, or any other course you can recommend.

03:32:01.000 --> 03:32:06.000
Mmm… I'll not recommend anything, especially time. Like, spend time on this one, and obviously with me, and with everyone inside your group, right?

03:32:06.000 --> 03:32:11.000
Okay.

03:32:11.000 --> 03:32:19.000
If you're, like, trying to explore Gen AI, then, like, it's more than enough for now. Don't go anywhere, like, don't try to explore anything.

03:32:19.000 --> 03:32:21.000
On a platform even, right? Just be with me for 2-3 months, uh, then you will be comfortable.

03:32:21.000 --> 03:32:34.000
Okay. Okay. Any specific things? Because, uh, I am having, like, a big bucket, uh, like, generally, uh, big data.

03:32:34.000 --> 03:32:40.000
Things I have explored, and I'm working in that section whenever we are doing the deployment.

03:32:40.000 --> 03:32:46.000
Cdi, CD, uh, Jen Keynes, and all. So, is that, like, any other.

03:32:46.000 --> 03:32:47.000
Things we need to learn, or is that…

03:32:47.000 --> 03:32:55.000
No, no, no, I think you know more than enough, I would say, because you are coming from, like, a tech background, right? And that pure tech background, so… Uh, I don't think so. And you are not even going to face much of issues, basically, with respect to understanding this one.

03:32:55.000 --> 03:33:07.000
Okay. Understood. And one last question, uh, to the, uh, uh, like, uh, be in the industry for 10 to 15 years.

03:33:07.000 --> 03:33:08.000
Mm-hmm.

03:33:08.000 --> 03:33:15.000
What is a good, uh, things to learn? Like, uh, be the technical or, like, uh, any strategic.

03:33:15.000 --> 03:33:16.000
Planning, uh, or, like, what are the…

03:33:16.000 --> 03:33:26.000
Well, I would say… I would say, uh, 15 years or so, uh, it requires now everything. So everything means starting from a solution designing, from a client engagement.

03:33:26.000 --> 03:33:36.000
Team and management, delivering a product to keep on generating a new demand, eventually, like, generating a revenue for a company. It requires everything now.

03:33:36.000 --> 03:33:58.000
So, the complete, like, uh, I would say, product owner. Basically. So, who is responsible for tech delivery, connecting with the clients, or maybe to your stakeholders, and developing a new feature, shipping… those features as soon as possible with the speed of AI, obviously. So, that is, uh, like, required.

03:33:58.000 --> 03:34:05.000
Yep. Uh, yes, Alta, please go ahead.

03:34:05.000 --> 03:34:10.000
Yeah, I do. Uh, Arman, Ridesh? Anyone? Anyone can go ahead now. I think we have, like, a… Yes, yes, you are able, yeah.

03:34:10.000 --> 03:34:11.000
Yes.

03:34:11.000 --> 03:34:20.000
Yes, sir, am I audible? Yes, sir. So, good afternoon, Seven, everyone, and thank you.

03:34:20.000 --> 03:34:29.000
For giving me this opportunity. So, my question is that… Like, in intensive quota, they are most of internship.

03:34:29.000 --> 03:34:35.000
Project where I have to knowledge of web development. And in my college also.

03:34:35.000 --> 03:34:46.000
Do a vibe coding. Simple. Use a cursor, or maybe, uh, like, uh, Windsorf, and… put all those requirements, all those tabs, it will build it for you. Simple.

03:34:46.000 --> 03:34:50.000
Okay, that… it is my… my question, like, thank you so much.

03:34:50.000 --> 03:34:53.000
Yeah, thanks. Yeah, it is, go ahead.

03:34:53.000 --> 03:34:56.000
Uh, so… good afternoon, sir. Uh, so, sir, I am Frazier.

03:34:56.000 --> 03:35:01.000
Government is, yeah? Mm-hmm.

03:35:01.000 --> 03:35:07.000
So, I have learned, like, machine learning, deep learning. Currently, I'm going through Gen AI.

03:35:07.000 --> 03:35:08.000
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

03:35:08.000 --> 03:35:14.000
So, most of the companies in my college are, like, uh, they're asking for software developers.

03:35:14.000 --> 03:35:15.000
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

03:35:15.000 --> 03:35:25.000
And, uh, companies are, uh, coming with data science role. They are, like, expecting, like, an internship experience.

03:35:25.000 --> 03:35:26.000
That is, I don't have… Cool. Uh, I'm learning about, uh, right now, Gen AI.

03:35:26.000 --> 03:35:30.000
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

03:35:30.000 --> 03:35:35.000
So, DNA is also expecting, like, 2 or 3 years experience.

03:35:35.000 --> 03:35:36.000
So, what I have to do?

03:35:36.000 --> 03:36:00.000
No, not like, not like that. So there are companies, there are companies, basically, who is… who is offering you, like, a… opportunities. So, it's not like that. Again, so, see, the thing is that everything will not be available with every company, but I'm not saying that there is no company which is not offering opportunities refresher. I have seen that, right? Every day, I'm getting a news and message from my student, and they have got players, they have got placed here, they have got placed here.

03:36:00.000 --> 03:36:03.000
So, it's… there, you have to hunt.

03:36:03.000 --> 03:36:09.000
Uh, so my question is, like, can you guide me as a facer what I have to do?

03:36:09.000 --> 03:36:11.000
Because I have learned MLDL statistically.

03:36:11.000 --> 03:36:19.000
As of now, as of now, as of now, nothing, join a class on every Saturday to Sunday, 9am IST. Sit with me for 4-5 hours, right?

03:36:19.000 --> 03:36:22.000
On Saturday and Sunday. This sort of… this should be a routine for next two months, at least.

03:36:22.000 --> 03:36:26.000
Sure. Sure, that's true.

03:36:26.000 --> 03:36:35.000
Then you will get used to it, and then you will do it, yeah? So just, just do that. Minimalistic. Always, always go with the minimalistic. When you're not able to understand anything in your life, right?

03:36:35.000 --> 03:36:36.000
I'm not just talking about the course. I'm talking about the life. When you're not able to understand anything in your life.

03:36:36.000 --> 03:36:39.000
Listen.

03:36:39.000 --> 03:36:41.000
Go minimalistic.

03:36:41.000 --> 03:36:51.000
Uh, but sir, my… one of my friend is, uh… is working at, like, JNI role in… amongst the robotics company.

03:36:51.000 --> 03:36:58.000
He's saying that, like, data science is, like, uh. Whilst, uh, having watched syllabus. So, you know, to shift to JNI.

03:36:58.000 --> 03:37:07.000
Not at all, not at all. So, you will find some friends who will give you wrong advices, and that is normal in the world.

03:37:07.000 --> 03:37:09.000
Yeah, thanks, thanks. Fingers.

03:37:09.000 --> 03:37:16.000
Don't… you should not listen to all of your friends. Yeah, thank you, yeah.

03:37:16.000 --> 03:37:21.000
Okay, so next one, M will, uh, you can go ahead with that. Manmeet, any, anyone, go ahead, guys.

03:37:21.000 --> 03:37:24.000
Yeah. Go ahead, go ahead, anyone, go ahead, yeah, hi, hi, Manavit. Manamit, yes, Manamit, please go ahead.

03:37:24.000 --> 03:37:28.000
Hi, sir.

03:37:28.000 --> 03:37:37.000
Yeah, so… actually, I'm… Power BI developer, so I am having, uh, 5 years of experience in this field.

03:37:37.000 --> 03:37:38.000
So now I'm looking for data science, uh, as a career, like, to move.

03:37:38.000 --> 03:37:43.000
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

03:37:43.000 --> 03:37:49.000
So, will Gen AI or any other course in this data science.

03:37:49.000 --> 03:37:54.000
Which course will be relevant for me, uh, as a Power BI developer?

03:37:54.000 --> 03:37:57.000
So, you are trying to run just a Power BI? Like, you are trying to upgrade, right?

03:37:57.000 --> 03:37:59.000
Yeah, I'm trying to upgrade and want to…

03:37:59.000 --> 03:38:04.000
Then this one, this one. As of now, this one. See, I have, like, a lot of courses on my dashboard.

03:38:04.000 --> 03:38:09.000
Uh, but yeah, so, uh, as a first-time learner, I'll not suggest you.

03:38:09.000 --> 03:38:11.000
Let's join this one. Yep. Yeah, yeah.

03:38:11.000 --> 03:38:14.000
Okay, okay, thanks, thank you.

03:38:14.000 --> 03:38:15.000
Uh, Emil, please go ahead. Hey, hey, hey.

03:38:15.000 --> 03:38:20.000
Hi, Sudanship. So, my question is.

03:38:20.000 --> 03:38:21.000
Mm-hmm.

03:38:21.000 --> 03:38:30.000
Uh, basically, like, whatever the ML models or the probability distributions and all this stuff, whatever we have learned earlier.

03:38:30.000 --> 03:38:43.000
So, do you feel that there will be a necessity of those concepts in the current gene? Like, if I'm trying to achieve something in Gen AI.

03:38:43.000 --> 03:38:44.000
Okay, okay, uh-huh. Mm-hmm.

03:38:44.000 --> 03:38:48.000
Agent decay or MCP. So… Integrating in these things, do I fit those pieces in this.

03:38:48.000 --> 03:38:49.000
Part, I just want to.

03:38:49.000 --> 03:39:07.000
Okay, so I'll try to give you an answer in a little different way, because I keep on getting this kind of a question that, uh, do I have to explore statistics? Do I have to explore, uh, old, uh, probability-based model, or, like, an old neural network concept, all of these things, because now LLMs are able to do everything, right?

03:39:07.000 --> 03:39:17.000
See, we are able to build a space station. Right? Iss specification is there, International Space Station, 9. Obviously, it works on a law of physics.

03:39:17.000 --> 03:39:30.000
Right? And still, when we start learning of physics from a childhood, so we try to explore it from a very, very basic, although we have built such kind of a system, we have built a, uh, like a.

03:39:30.000 --> 03:39:38.000
A lot of big, big infrastructure, but still, we try to start learning from the basic.

03:39:38.000 --> 03:39:47.000
Right? Technically, we as a human being, so when we grow up, so we first of all try to learn A, B, C, D, then we try to learn our words, and then eventually, uh, sentences, and then with the experience.

03:39:47.000 --> 03:39:50.000
So we are able to communicate, we are able to talk.

03:39:50.000 --> 03:40:03.000
So, basic was relevant. Even mathematics, right? So, we always start from addition. 1 plus 1, right? And then we do all complex calculation, like exponential or even logarithmic, or maybe a differential, integration kind of a thing.

03:40:03.000 --> 03:40:16.000
So, see, as a human being, it doesn't matter how good the machines are, or maybe, like, uh… what system does exist in this entire world.

03:40:16.000 --> 03:40:38.000
I will always suggest that start from a base. A basic, I would say, because this is not the end of the world. The kind of AI that you are able to see, the kind of a system that you are able to see, someone has built it, right? After having a basic knowledge, coming from the same background, coming from the same ABCD, right? And the AI that you will be able to see, the world that you will be able to see after 5 years, it will be way more advanced than that, but again, built on the same thing.

03:40:38.000 --> 03:40:47.000
Simbiz, right? And even after 100 years, as a human race, if we are going to imagine, so obviously, it will be built on our basic building blocks itself.

03:40:47.000 --> 03:40:58.000
Right? And that… the next advancement. So… If you are trying to build some wrapper, or maybe you are working just as a developer, if you're thinking short-term.

03:40:58.000 --> 03:41:05.000
Then, learn the technology, learn the framework. Get into a job. But if you're thinking long-term, right.

03:41:05.000 --> 03:41:21.000
Always start from the basic, a rock bottom. That is my take on this one, right? Because this is how the entire world has evolved. We still learn a basic principle of the lights, right? We still learn a neutral law, basically, all three laws.

03:41:21.000 --> 03:41:25.000
We still try to discuss about the Archimity principle of buoyancy.

03:41:25.000 --> 03:41:26.000
Yeah.

03:41:26.000 --> 03:41:38.000
Right? So, basic is relevant, it will be relevant, even for me, even for my kids, even for my next to next generation, right? And, uh, doesn't matter, like, LLMs are able to solve the problems, or it is able to, like, uh.

03:41:38.000 --> 03:41:51.000
Uh, do her things for me. Doesn't mean that my… those probabilistic model and the machine learning and the deep learning models are irrelevant. No, because next phase, if someone is building, someone is developing, you have to go through the same route.

03:41:51.000 --> 03:41:54.000
Otherwise, you will not be able to build the advanced AI.

03:41:54.000 --> 03:41:55.000
Right? It is… but again, but again, yeah, it depends upon the person-to-person.

03:41:55.000 --> 03:42:00.000
Okay. Yeah, yeah. So, my…

03:42:00.000 --> 03:42:08.000
What is your objective in your life? So, if your objective is to get a job, build a product, then again, I don't say that go and explore machine learning and statistics.

03:42:08.000 --> 03:42:14.000
Not required. Right. But yeah, if you're thinking something long-term, 10-year, 20-year.

03:42:14.000 --> 03:42:15.000
Then, yes. Yeah, now go ahead with the question. Next one.

03:42:15.000 --> 03:42:21.000
So, my query is, uh, actually, it's interrelated to that question. Why I asked you that question is because.

03:42:21.000 --> 03:42:24.000
Mm-hmm.

03:42:24.000 --> 03:42:27.000
So, one of my friends, who is from a non-technical background, he's completely new to the complete machine learning, or all the AI components.

03:42:27.000 --> 03:42:33.000
Mm-hmm.

03:42:33.000 --> 03:42:34.000
Mm-hmm.

03:42:34.000 --> 03:42:42.000
So, he asked me a suggestion, like, should I learn? Like, seeing the complete, uh, structure, like, basics from the max, stats, and seeing everything.

03:42:42.000 --> 03:42:43.000
Mm-hmm. Hmm, hmm.

03:42:43.000 --> 03:42:48.000
He felt that, okay, this is very big, this is very huge, I can't go through all these things. Uh, at the moment.

03:42:48.000 --> 03:42:49.000
So, he asked me, do I need to go through all these things?

03:42:49.000 --> 03:42:53.000
Hmm.

03:42:53.000 --> 03:42:54.000
Simple. So, your next question should be that what is your objective?

03:42:54.000 --> 03:42:59.000
I have to study all these things.

03:42:59.000 --> 03:43:02.000
His objective is getting into an IT background with AI, that's it.

03:43:02.000 --> 03:43:13.000
Then it's not required, right? Then it's not required because just go ahead, learn some framework, right? Maybe, like, an kind of a framework, which is, again, a no-code kind of framework, and there is a job for that.

03:43:13.000 --> 03:43:25.000
Right? That's the reason I simply said that. You should be clear with your objective. See, developers are not going to go through the same curriculum which actual scientist and researchers will go through.

03:43:25.000 --> 03:43:26.000
Eh, take it.

03:43:26.000 --> 03:43:35.000
And I think we all agree on that, right? Yeah? A person who is doing a… a person who is doing a PhD, obviously, they go through a different path. A person who come into a development industry or IT industry, right, on every level of job, they follow the different path.

03:43:35.000 --> 03:43:46.000
Right. So, simple thing is that what you want from yourself in next one year, then 5 year, and then in next 20 years.

03:43:46.000 --> 03:43:47.000
So I can refer him this… this course, right? I can refer it. He can… is, since being a non-technical person.

03:43:47.000 --> 03:44:01.000
That's it. And accordingly, you can learn that thing. Hmm. Exactly, exactly, exactly. So, if… Yeah, so if you have… if your goal is to, like, just get into an industry, obviously, go ahead, join it, and build something, and then get, you know, industry.

03:44:01.000 --> 03:44:06.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thanks. Yeah, Siddharth, please go ahead with your question.

03:44:06.000 --> 03:44:09.000
Yeah. Yeah, hi, Sudangshu. So, I first enrolled with you around 5 years back for the data science course.

03:44:09.000 --> 03:44:13.000
Yeah.

03:44:13.000 --> 03:44:20.000
So, I… yeah. So, I learned many algorithms at that time, like FastRCNN, and.

03:44:20.000 --> 03:44:22.000
Convoluted CNN, NLP, BART transformer, etc. But because of fate, I became a data engineer, AU data engineer.

03:44:22.000 --> 03:44:26.000
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

03:44:26.000 --> 03:44:29.000
So, last 3, 4 years, I am working in that profile. Now, since I have enrolled with you, I am trying to revise those algorithms.

03:44:29.000 --> 03:44:33.000
Mm-hmm.

03:44:33.000 --> 03:44:40.000
And try to remember. So, is it, uh, revision of or means remembering those algorithms and logics?

03:44:40.000 --> 03:44:47.000
Compulsory for this, and also, when I was learning, doing the other course previously, I could not get into data science profile because.

03:44:47.000 --> 03:44:53.000
Since I was already working, many companies asked me for hands-on experience in projects.

03:44:53.000 --> 03:44:54.000
Hmm, hmm.

03:44:54.000 --> 03:44:59.000
So, uh, so they did not… when I… in that first call only, they will ask me in the office project, have you worked or not?

03:44:59.000 --> 03:45:00.000
Hmm, hmm. Hmm, okay.

03:45:00.000 --> 03:45:05.000
So, and I did not lie, I said that I have academic experience, so there only they used to reject me.

03:45:05.000 --> 03:45:11.000
So, but seeing in my office, I got a Databricks and Data Engineer role, so I could become a data engineer.

03:45:11.000 --> 03:45:12.000
Hmm, hmm.

03:45:12.000 --> 03:45:22.000
And so, my question is currently, also, I'm working as a data engineer, so if this ex… These projects become more or less like an academic experience.

03:45:22.000 --> 03:45:23.000
Okay.

03:45:23.000 --> 03:45:29.000
No, not at all. At least not for this badge. So, the project that I have mentioned, so it will not work like an academic one, it will work like a complete end-to-end, uh.

03:45:29.000 --> 03:45:35.000
Like, a industry-grade one. At least the first project.

03:45:35.000 --> 03:45:36.000
Second, third, and fourth, it will be small, but yeah, first one.

03:45:36.000 --> 03:45:40.000
Okay, so I can…

03:45:40.000 --> 03:45:45.000
Yeah, yeah, thank you. Okay, Rani Atna, please go ahead, ma'am.

03:45:45.000 --> 03:45:46.000
Okay, so that's truth.

03:45:46.000 --> 03:45:50.000
Hello, ma'am. Yeah, please go ahead.

03:45:50.000 --> 03:46:02.000
I'm a particular person. I am working in the industry for 15 years in procurement and supply chain, and then I moved into consulting, and now I'm into tech research.

03:46:02.000 --> 03:46:03.000
Mm-hmm.

03:46:03.000 --> 03:46:17.000
So, because of all these ChatGPT perplexity and all, uh, consulting and research roles are really in danger. So I thought of, uh, upgrading myself, but then… I'm totally a non-technical person, haven't done any programming ever.

03:46:17.000 --> 03:46:19.000
So, uh, what…

03:46:19.000 --> 03:46:27.000
It will… it will take one month of time, at minimum. Again, depends upon your schedule and the kind of effort you are going to put up.

03:46:27.000 --> 03:46:41.000
To learn not in depth of programming, but a basic one. And I think you should do that. So that, going forward, you will be comfortable, because believe me, when we were writing a code and doing a project.

03:46:41.000 --> 03:46:53.000
Uh, at that point of a time, uh, you will feel a little bit of, like, a hiccups and pain. So, it's… you have a time? Spend some time with the programming, uh, lectures are already available, everything is already available.

03:46:53.000 --> 03:47:00.000
And, uh, you should, you should do some practice.

03:47:00.000 --> 03:47:10.000
Yes, ma'am. Any other question? Hello?

03:47:10.000 --> 03:47:11.000
Mm-hmm.

03:47:11.000 --> 03:47:18.000
My colleagues, they are moving into AI forum management roles. So, the idea of doing this, uh, course also is that, that even if I go into AI product management kind of rooms, if I try for that.

03:47:18.000 --> 03:47:19.000
As you know, a district to somebody else also, we should know.

03:47:19.000 --> 03:47:21.000
Mm-hmm.

03:47:21.000 --> 03:47:31.000
Things… if we want to be in the industry for a long time, then we should know things end-to-end, and we should be able to build things.

03:47:31.000 --> 03:47:36.000
By ourselves. That's why, even if we try to get into AI product management, I should know the complete.

03:47:36.000 --> 03:47:38.000
For the stack development around also.

03:47:38.000 --> 03:47:48.000
Product managers, project managers is, like, uh, their job is, uh, like, uh, literally… under a lot of scrutiny in many companies.

03:47:48.000 --> 03:47:55.000
Uh, so, uh, I would say try to become a techno-functional product manager. I think that'll be much better.

03:47:55.000 --> 03:47:59.000
Means you should have… you should know the technology.

03:47:59.000 --> 03:48:04.000
He scores it, and then even further in your next courses and all will help me, right?

03:48:04.000 --> 03:48:13.000
Only this one, ma'am. As of now, just do one. See, I'll keep on bringing hundreds of courses, but yeah, as of now, only one. Just go with this.

03:48:13.000 --> 03:48:24.000
Yep. Okay, so Vinas, anyone can go ahead, Sneha, Vinas, Vikas, Nagandra, Krishna Pratap.

03:48:24.000 --> 03:48:25.000
Arman, yeah. Go ahead. Hi, Nagindra, hello.

03:48:25.000 --> 03:48:35.000
Hi, Solutions. Uh, could you please mention again, uh, what is the… requirement of PC.

03:48:35.000 --> 03:48:39.000
Oh, sorry, what is the requirement of? Okay, PC, uh, system, right?

03:48:39.000 --> 03:48:40.000
Oh, she's a gunfire.

03:48:40.000 --> 03:48:55.000
Any… I think any IN system will work, uh, so, uh, any… let me open up my Amazon account. Uh, maybe I can… search something for you. And again, this is not a last recommendation, you can go with any of, like, of your choice.

03:48:55.000 --> 03:49:04.000
So, laptop, uh… Laptop i9. So, sorry, IE, I have to type, right?

03:49:04.000 --> 03:49:12.000
Laptop i9. So, you can go with any, like, later generation, so not the older generation, because that will choke.

03:49:12.000 --> 03:49:24.000
And again, so, uh, maybe you can go ahead with the ASUS version, that's completely fine. Uh, you can go with the Lenovo one, but yeah, don't go with too much of an expensive, like, one.

03:49:24.000 --> 03:49:38.000
I believe this ASUS is going to work. And, uh, again, there is a system from our RTX… Which I was using. So, Asus MSI, yeah. So, go with MSI. Msi is also a very good brand, and it's a gaming laptop, gaming, uh, why I'm saying gaming.

03:49:38.000 --> 03:49:51.000
So, because it will be having more, like, a power and robustness. For rough and tough use. So, and it will not cost you much. So maybe you can go ahead with Asus, this one. So, inan processor, that's fine. 16gb RAM.

03:49:51.000 --> 03:49:58.000
So RAM should be a bit more… 8GB into 2 slot, fine, 1TB of hard disk.

03:49:58.000 --> 03:50:04.000
Uh, NVIDIA for T60, they are giving you, yeah. So, for T60, this one is fine. This one is not fine, it seems.

03:50:04.000 --> 03:50:11.000
They are not giving you a GPU, it's not be an integrated one. Yeah. So go with a little bit of GPU.

03:50:11.000 --> 03:50:29.000
Uh, so I believe this one is better. Msi is also… I have been using MSI laptops since a very, very long time, so… I like it, I like this brand, and uh… yeah, so their configuration, their speed, and everything is fine. At least for next one and a half year, one, one and a half year, even with the rough and tough use.

03:50:29.000 --> 03:50:33.000
It will not give you a problem. After one and a half year or two year.

03:50:33.000 --> 03:50:38.000
Doesn't matter what laptop you're going to buy, it'll give you a column.

03:50:38.000 --> 03:50:47.000
So I hope it's clear, right, with respect to system. Yeah, I can do that, right? To someone's… Yeah. Okay, so Arman, anyone, go ahead, guys.

03:50:47.000 --> 03:50:53.000
Yeah, yeah, thank you.

03:50:53.000 --> 03:50:54.000
So, Sunniharman, yeah, please go ahead. Yeah. Yeah.

03:50:54.000 --> 03:51:01.000
Hello, sir. Hello, sir. So, I'm a fresher, and I have skills in data and domain, and I'm… Seeking for a job in data and domain.

03:51:01.000 --> 03:51:03.000
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

03:51:03.000 --> 03:51:13.000
I use a job portal also, I use LinkedIn, Nokra.com. But not getting shortlisted, sir.

03:51:13.000 --> 03:51:14.000
Mm-hmm.

03:51:14.000 --> 03:51:20.000
I'm from Pune University with CGPA 9.09 or so, and… I have the case kids also. But I… there is shortlisting issue, so how can I get a job? And now I am a…

03:51:20.000 --> 03:51:29.000
Oh, first of all, work on your resume, eh? Try to align your resume, and then only shortlisting happens, because anyhow, system is doing shortlisting, right? Ats system.

03:51:29.000 --> 03:51:36.000
So, first of all, you have to put up the relevant things into a resume, and then, uh, apply more and more for our startup.

03:51:36.000 --> 03:51:39.000
They will give you more opportunity, as a fresher.

03:51:39.000 --> 03:51:48.000
And, uh, as a… as I am now, Janet is now learning… There is data for freshers opportunity, because I saw the… on LinkedIn.

03:51:48.000 --> 03:51:53.000
Yeah, there are… no, no, it's not like that. So, there are… there are so many opportunities. See, LinkedIn is not the only platform, right?

03:51:53.000 --> 03:51:57.000
Go to Nagri, go to Monster, go to Hi-Rest. There are so many other platforms, right? Apply… apply on a startup website itself.

03:51:57.000 --> 03:52:01.000
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

03:52:01.000 --> 03:52:08.000
Yep. Yep, thanks. Yeah. Kristen Pratap, Silvar, Sneha, Vikas, anyone? Yeah, please go ahead.

03:52:08.000 --> 03:52:17.000
Hello, Sudancio. Yeah, so even I am associated with Shenzai and Euron, uh, was not able to transition to data science.

03:52:17.000 --> 03:52:25.000
Thanks for this. So, I just wanted to know your view on the no-code tools like NA, then, you know, should we consider those, uh.

03:52:25.000 --> 03:52:28.000
Uh-huh.

03:52:28.000 --> 03:52:35.000
Uh, while building our, uh, application building with code, uh, in some cases, or… Because it gives you quick implementation and results.

03:52:35.000 --> 03:52:44.000
See, they'll… Yeah, see, there are two things, right, over here. So, let's suppose, uh, I'm trying to automate my task.

03:52:44.000 --> 03:52:50.000
And, uh, obviously, if init can do it, because init n can't do the… everything, right? That's also true.

03:52:50.000 --> 03:53:06.000
Uh, but yeah, it's a very good one, powerful one. Uh, you can, like, do it without writing a code. So, let's suppose if I'm trying to automate my own task. Yes, I can use init… n or such kind of a system, but let's suppose if I'm trying to build a product for my company or my client.

03:53:06.000 --> 03:53:13.000
Right? And, uh, which they are going to sell, or they are going to scale, or something like that. So, in that case, I have to go from a scratch development.

03:53:13.000 --> 03:53:22.000
Yeah? The sky's the limit. For example, let's suppose your client is a healthcare client, or maybe a finance client, and your client is asking you that, okay.

03:53:22.000 --> 03:53:39.000
So try to fine-tune a model for me, and that model should be fine-tuned on my proprietary dataset. It should go in my hosting platform, so maybe they're using a bare metal or their own server, or maybe their cloud server, right? It should go over there, it should be able to solve this customer problem, that customer problem.

03:53:39.000 --> 03:53:57.000
Now, over the init and will not work. Very simple, right? Nowhere you can use… nowhere close, you will be able to use NA10. So, N810 is not a solution of the entire world, otherwise NN would have become the… everything of the world, right? So…

03:53:57.000 --> 03:54:01.000
We can automate a lot of tasks, right? But again, that depends what problem I'm trying to solve.

03:54:01.000 --> 03:54:07.000
Right? One platform is not going to be a solution for everything.

03:54:07.000 --> 03:54:08.000
That's my answer.

03:54:08.000 --> 03:54:13.000
Yeah, but, I mean, like, building on some specific cases, which gives you quick results, rather than… not everything, but something we can… Yeah.

03:54:13.000 --> 03:54:19.000
Obviously, it's true. Yeah, no, no, no, obviously, see, I'm not saying that you should not use it.

03:54:19.000 --> 03:54:23.000
If it is solving your problem, right? You should immediately use it.

03:54:23.000 --> 03:54:24.000
Okay, yeah.

03:54:24.000 --> 03:54:40.000
And it's a beautiful platform, obviously. They have built a very good platform. They have, like, created almost every kind of our plugins, right? And drag and drop, like, build it very quickly and very easily. So, you should use it, but like I said, client example I have given to you, so in that case, it will not work.

03:54:40.000 --> 03:54:48.000
Yep, thanks. Okay, so Vinas Krishna Prattap, Silva Sneha, yeah, please, anyone?

03:54:48.000 --> 03:54:56.000
Is different from the general process automation. Actually, it's not different, it's actually, like, intelligent process automation.

03:54:56.000 --> 03:55:06.000
With the help of LLMs. Okay, so if there is no question for me, so hope, guys, all of you have liked, uh, today's session.

03:55:06.000 --> 03:55:10.000
Uh, there is no question for me, right? Okay, I have covered everything.

03:55:10.000 --> 03:55:16.000
So, hope all of you have lied it, all of you have loved it. So, from tomorrow onwards, we are going to start our syllabus.

03:55:16.000 --> 03:55:24.000
And, uh, where I will be, like, uh… Uh, let me mute all, okay.

03:55:24.000 --> 03:55:34.000
So, allow participant… Fine. So, from tomorrow onwards, guys, not like love at all. Okay, yeah, thank you so much.

03:55:34.000 --> 03:55:47.000
So, uh, hope all of you are going to love it. Just one single advice to all of you, that try to… become a little bit disciplined person for next 2-3 months.

03:55:47.000 --> 03:55:55.000
Believe me, it is going to help you out. Uh, you don't have to do a lot of things in your life, you don't have to go and explore a lot of things in a life.

03:55:55.000 --> 03:56:01.000
At least once at a time, you should do it, which we are going to do it together in next two to three months.

03:56:01.000 --> 03:56:09.000
I'm always here in your group and inside a class. To help you out, but at the end of the day, it's your life.

03:56:09.000 --> 03:56:22.000
At the end of the day, it's your journey. I'm just a mentor who will be with you for a couple of months, just for this batch. Obviously, I'll be there for other batches, and all of you can join it, because with the Iran Plus, you can access all the badges, but yeah.

03:56:22.000 --> 03:56:32.000
So, for these batches, I will be with you for a couple of months, try to leverage it as much as possible in a group. I will be available anyhow for the infinite time.

03:56:32.000 --> 03:56:37.000
But you have to put up a real effort, without any kind of excuse.

03:56:37.000 --> 03:56:47.000
Then only you will be able to get a success. Right? And that is the only thing which matters. If you are going to become a lazy person, if you're going to procrastinate.

03:56:47.000 --> 03:56:52.000
Your result will show you the similar kind of a trend.

03:56:52.000 --> 03:57:02.000
So, just advice. Try to work as much as possible, go fast, like, don't go slow, go fast, as fast as possible.

03:57:02.000 --> 03:57:08.000
And, uh, let's try to make a transition in next 4 to 5 months at max.

03:57:08.000 --> 03:57:15.000
Because, uh, when you do a transition, as you have seen, many people have done the transition, and everyday people are doing it.

03:57:15.000 --> 03:57:22.000
Then only I count myself. Or I think myself as a successful person, because as a mentor.

03:57:22.000 --> 03:57:28.000
It's not just my job to, like, deliver the… come here and deliver the lecture. No. That's one of… part of my job.

03:57:28.000 --> 03:57:31.000
But at the end of the day, if my students are going to make a transition.

03:57:31.000 --> 03:57:37.000
That makes me really, really happy. Anyhow, you are going to work, it's your hard work, I do agree, right?

03:57:37.000 --> 03:57:41.000
But I'll take a little bit of credit out of it. Maybe you will give it to me.

03:57:41.000 --> 03:57:48.000
Uh, but yeah, at the end of the day, we all are here to achieve a particular goal, so let's try to achieve it together.

03:57:48.000 --> 03:57:54.000
And for that, there is no shortcut. There is no overnight things which is going to happen with me or with any one of you.

03:57:54.000 --> 03:58:01.000
It's going to take a pure, pure, pure hard work. And I believe all of you are willing to put that effort.

03:58:01.000 --> 03:58:07.000
But that, uh, thank you so much, everyone. From tomorrow, I'm going to start a real class, technically your syllabus, I'm going to start. Right.

03:58:07.000 --> 03:58:14.000
Uh, so… and as we will… so initially, I'll go slow, don't worry, I'll go slow initially, and I'll try to discuss everything from the scratch.

03:58:14.000 --> 03:58:19.000
And then, as we will be, you know, mid of the journey, we'll try to pick up their speed.

03:58:19.000 --> 03:58:39.000
From there. So, any meetups are… not now. As of now, I have not planned Sarek, so… Sir, I asked one question already. Okay, then it's great. Okay, so fine, guys, thank you so much, take care. Now, whatever question you have, put me, uh, put it inside a group, so we all, we are already in a group, right?

03:58:39.000 --> 03:58:43.000
Uh, so I'll try to answer over there. So with that, can you give a status on a live coding?

03:58:43.000 --> 03:58:46.000
Uh, status is not required, we'll do it in a class.

03:58:46.000 --> 03:58:56.000
Yeah, live coding. Could you please share the WhatsApp group link? Uh, Kesha, you will be able to find a WhatsApp group link inside a dashboard. So just go inside the dashboard, you will be able to find it.

03:58:56.000 --> 03:59:03.000
Yeah, it's already there. And everyone is, like, uh, joining. Do we have a campus investor? Not now.

03:59:03.000 --> 03:59:15.000
Not now. So, yeah. Finally, thank you so much, take care, it was a pleasure meeting all of you on a very first day, and we are only now connected on our WhatsApp, so let's connect over there. With that.

03:59:15.000 --> 03:59:17.000
Thank you so much. I'll see you again tomorrow, same time, 9 a.m. Ist.

03:59:17.000 --> 03:59:21.000
Simple
