01:01:54	archit Mehrotra:	ok sir
01:01:58	Krishna Aleti:	pls explain the conversion and how does higher shape means higher accuracy
01:02:04	Shahid Raza:	to execute this we may need to install bumpy and requests right?
01:02:11	kartik mojhindru:	how this conversion have happened can we cover a bit on that?and can the dimensions be limited
01:02:15	navneet kumar:	how to use upi key
01:02:16	Supreeth S Shetty:	SO basically its N dimensional,. so based on our text, the shape varies, meaning it can be above or below 1536
01:02:24	P Gautham Pai:	can u show us how to use other embedding models from hugging face too?
01:02:49	Avinash Adsare:	why always len is same
01:02:55	Muhammad Arslan:	then how much data we pass to this model at single time. and how its ans our questions
01:03:13	Armaan Shaikh:	why only 1536 why not something else?
01:03:21	Krishna Aleti:	pls explain the conversion and how does higher shape means higher accuracy
01:03:39	Anil M:	Sorry basic doubt  here  shape (1536)your are referring as dimension ?
01:04:08	Avinash Adsare:	Sir why length is not changing
01:04:14	Armaan Shaikh:	why only 1536 dimension why not something else?
01:04:15	Priyanshu L:	further this dimension can increase beyond 1536 also

01:04:44	Abhrajit Pal:	its always showing 1536 eve single word or long sentence
01:05:06	Vipin Vishal:	3 pen example
01:05:10	sandeep saraf:	sir test it with a long sentence
01:06:35	Ritesh Kumar:	screen is not visible
01:06:44	Aman Singh:	any parcel box will be good example
01:06:51	Aman Singh:	or carton box
01:07:06	Raj Dalsaniya:	Abhrajit, it will always 1536 fir single word or long sentence. that is output dim of embedding model
01:07:18	mukesh kumar:	sir, please use other colour when you draw, red is not visible in my pc.
01:07:24	Lokesh Naidu:	yes sir
01:08:41	Ajith chadaga:	what is the need to increase the cordinate , does the clarity improve
01:08:43	Aman Singh:	increase brightness Mukesh, then you will be able to see red
01:08:45	Prashant Rai:	(1536) mean (x,y,z,N)
01:08:46	Anil M:	Got it sir , thank you 
X1,y1 (2d) shape 2
x1,y2,z3 (3d) shape 3
x1 ,y2,z3,.... n1536) shape is 1536

so how many co ordinates we have to choose ? in this case what is the reason of choosing 1536..
any criteria in choosing shape sir?
01:08:51	Supreeth S Shetty:	So this model has 1536 dimension, and when ever we use this model it alwys repesent the point in space which has 1536 dimentsion
01:08:53	Sonu Kumar:	Sir , you want to show like this link https://projector.tensorflow.org/
01:09:24	Raj Dalsaniya:	yes supreeth
01:09:25	Amarendra Kushwaha:	compressed vector
01:09:37	Aman Singh:	X1,y1 (2d) shape 2x1,y2,z3 (3d) shape 3x1 ,y2,z3,.... n1536) shape will be shape 1536
01:09:42	Pushpa J:	here 1536 means each word is compared with 1536 simultaneous word?
01:09:43	SHASHANK Padelkar:	so does this vector output represent like 1d ,3d,5d,6d output in vector db?
01:09:57	Prabhakar Kumar:	can you please execute in .py the code with you have written?
01:10:50	Deepak Jain:	can we say, more dimensions stands for better model?
01:10:55	Pushpa J:	what is the need of this 1536 dimension? why we need it
01:11:36	Krishna Aleti:	what is size here?
01:11:42	Supreeth S Shetty:	1024,0
01:11:48	Krishna Aleti:	what is size here?
01:12:22	Muhammad Arslan:	sequence length is input??
01:12:36	Amarendra Kushwaha:	yes
01:12:41	Rajesh Sharma:	does the embedding vector represents specific quality about the text with +ve or -ve bigger/smaller values?
01:12:45	Lokesh Naidu:	what scenario we can use this models sir please explain
01:12:45	kartik mojhindru:	can you please share what is the significance of ach of these attributes?
01:12:51	Shahid Raza:	so creating RAG based system we need two models?
01:14:28	Raj Dalsaniya:	Pushpa Text have many features.. if we represent text to one number semantic meaning of text will be lost. like understanding similar word model can not understand. hope this help you understand why we need higher dimension for word or sentence.
01:14:45	Aman Singh:	model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
01:15:22	Md Akhtar:	we don't need api acees to use qwen
01:16:57	sudhanshu kumar:	from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformermodel = SentenceTransformer("Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B")documents = [    "The capital of China is Beijing.",    "Gravity is a force that attracts two bodies towards each other. It gives weight to physical objects and is responsible for the movement of planets around the sun.",]document_embeddings = model.encode(documents)
01:17:05	sudhanshu kumar:	pip install sentence-transformers
01:17:08	kartik mojhindru:	is it sentence_transformers or sentence-transformers?
01:17:09	Nishit Hirpara:	how to deploy model on local premises from hugging face
01:17:11	Mustafa Kamaal:	Why are we even doing this? Why do we need to know the embedding values?
01:17:12	Akhtar Nadeem:	Disable other people chat
01:18:50	Manas Pandey:	Longer text chunks …Higher dimension will help ?
01:19:01	Syed Waquaruddin:	yes

01:19:47	sudhanshu kumar:	pip install sentence-transformers
01:19:57	kaushal gupta:	So full statement  given input represent single point aftervembedding
01:19:57	Pushpa J:	does 1536 dimension have limitation on length of sentence or para graph we use?
01:21:09	Amarendra Kushwaha:	that’s just the size of the vector output from the embedding model (always fixed)
01:21:43	Muhammad Arslan:	sir no matter how much word we give its give fix output then it's make all my data is one point
01:23:41	Amarendra Kushwaha:	yes

01:30:04	kartik mojhindru:	not getting the orthogonal part
01:30:14	Muhammad Arslan:	how we decide the length of over sentence in long book
01:30:26	kartik mojhindru:	ok got it cos 90  = 0
01:30:39	SHASHANK Padelkar:	any output which is showing closer to -1
01:31:06	Nishit Hirpara:	result is different in my machine
01:31:23	sandeep saraf:	can we do it with mumerical data points as well
01:31:28	kaushal gupta:	How model embed the word.like bag of word or something technique?
01:31:51	Muhammad Arslan:	sir give you high level overview how data into vector make??
01:31:52	RAMESHKUMAR SELLAMUTHU:	how can we similarity word by word in between sentence?
01:32:14	Amarendra Kushwaha:	yes
01:32:16	Avinash Adsare:	S
01:32:25	Avinash Adsare:	paste the code sir
01:32:55	Nishit Hirpara:	I am using same model and same sentence still my machine is showing 0.744 and yours 0.78
01:33:02	Supreeth S Shetty:	sir 1 question regarding the conversion of text to vector, whats happening in the background, i know we are using a pre-trained a model, and it uses Transforeme with N layers, but do we have to know about it??
01:33:12	Joe Wilson:	yeah
01:33:19	Saiyam jain:	not able to run in local have to shift to colab
01:34:17	Devendra Yadav:	sir can you repeat why we are getting different vectors
01:34:25	Krishna Aleti:	what is the course name that u mentioned just now?
01:34:29	mukesh kumar:	pip install transformer
01:34:39	mukesh kumar:	Giving error
01:34:46	Vikash Kumar:	not the same anwer
01:34:48	Shahid Raza:	pip install sentence_transformers
01:34:52	Shivam Makwana:	nope
01:35:08	Avinash Adsare:	Sir please tell another method apart from manual method to check similarity
01:35:31	Amarendra Kushwaha:	yes
01:35:36	GALLA VENKAT:	yes
01:35:37	Aman Singh:	nice class
01:35:48	Lokesh Naidu:	fine sir
01:35:52	sandeep saraf:	can we use in numerical data
01:35:58	Sarfaraz A:	yes
01:36:08	Roja C:	Vector db
01:36:10	Arunava Nag:	main is VECCTOR but in DATABASES
01:36:10	Sunil Kumar:	vector db
01:36:12	GALI MALLIKARJUNA REDDY:	vector db
01:36:22	GALLA VENKAT:	to store the data
01:36:26	Dr Girish Supekar:	store the embeddings
01:36:28	GALI MALLIKARJUNA REDDY:	store the vectoe data
01:37:28	Shahid Raza:	vector…
01:37:41	Venkateshwar Rao Eturi:	Even if the same question is asked to me twice my answer will not be exactly same word to word though the essence will be same
01:38:16	Saiyam jain:	query will be converted to vector than we do similarity search hightest score text will be return as answer
01:39:02	Arunava Nag:	so this particular db, built on qwen embedding,  schema will be of 1024 columns ?   

and context would basically mean how many such rows are considered during final RETURN ..  correct ?
01:39:27	GALLA VENKAT:	got it sir
01:39:33	Mandar Aarondekar:	cool
01:39:47	GALLA VENKAT:	awesome class

01:41:25	Supreeth S Shetty:	dist 2 has higher similarity index sir
01:41:57	Arunava Nag:	so this particular db, built on qwen embedding,  schema will be of 1024 columns ?   

and context would basically mean how many such rows are considered during final RETURN ..  correct ?
01:41:59	Ganesh Sahu:	why sentence 1 not came

01:44:08	Amarendra Kushwaha:	yes
01:44:10	RAMESHKUMAR SELLAMUTHU:	is it working similar to key word search algorithm? how it is different from vector DB?

02:03:52	Shahid Raza:	his machine should have 3.10 in his machine
02:03:55	Prashant Rai:	i also face error
02:04:23	Shahid Raza:	better to install conda
02:05:04	Lalu Mahato:	Try uv: uv venv .venv --python=3.10
02:05:36	Shahid Raza:	do you feel it’s suggested to have on our machine?
02:05:56	Lalu Mahato:	pip install uv
uv venv .venv --python=3.10
02:06:00	Armaan Shaikh:	sir give the command for conda create
02:06:56	Aman Singh:	can you show us how to switch between python3.10 and python 3.12 in terminal without conda?
02:08:01	Shahid Raza:	Hi @Aman, you may need to create virtual environment to use itents

02:10:28	Aman Singh:	Hi @Shahid, I know. but I wanted sir to discuss and show because many people are freshers here
02:11:39	Shahid Raza:	ok
02:12:20	Mustafa Kamaal:	How do people even decide which model to use and which embedding model to use in real life practically???
02:12:37	Galla Venkat:	what is the parameter here?

03:52:52	Uday R:	sir me post krta hu question-rag humne implement kiya he par relevancy bht kam he, wo keywird basis pr search krta he, elastic hum use kr rhe he db, hum chahte he context based kare search, elastic team bolti he semantic se context search hota he pr ho nae raha he , semantic chunking bhi kiye he humne iska solutionor bhi que he mere sir pr awaz nae aa rhi he shayad
03:53:17	Sarfaraz A:	I think his concept of vector and dimension he has to look into
03:54:51	Ganesh Sahu:	Sudhanshu Sir could you please add last assignment on resource section
